## Draugr

At the urging of dark powers, the draugr emerge as eerie and emaciated figures, their pallid skin stretched tightly over their skeletal frames. Wretched remnants of long dead warriors, trapped in a cursed existence. Restless draugr, weakened by the weight of their perpetual torment, stagger forth with lethargic movements, knowing only the command of the one that summoned them. More deadly are the vengeful draugr, these malevolent beings retain a glimmer of their former strength, fueling their wrath with an insatiable desire for retribution. Their ancient weapon are now accursed relics that bear the weight of dark enchantments. Each strike carries a malefic touch, sapping vitality and infecting the living with a sense of dread.

Guiding these unhallowed hordes are the dread draugr skalds, twisted overseers who manipulate necromantic energies. With their sinister incantations, these powerful leaders amplify the fury within the draugr, unleashing a tide of evil power that makes them all the more formidable and relentless in their pursuit of vengeance upon the realms of the living.

## Skeletons and Zombies

In the realm of a malevolent necromancer, skeletal warriors and mindless zombies form the sinister ranks of the undead horde. Skeletons, clad in remnants of armor, wield clattering swords and rusted axes, their disciplined formations making up for their individual frailty. Zombies, once living but now rotting corpses, advance relentlessly in overwhelming numbers, driven by an insatiable hunger for flesh. Together, these unholy minions serve as the necromancer's obedient and expendable forces, bound to carry out their master's dark will.
