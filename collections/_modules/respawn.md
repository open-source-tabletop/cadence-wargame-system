title: Respawn
---

Respawn is a class based team skirmish, with influences from online multiplayer shooters.

### Playing Respawn

Respawn is best played on a 2ft x 3ft or similar sized area. Each game of Respawn lasts for 4 rounds. Models in Respawn are referred to throughout as **Characters**.

### Respawn

When a character is killed in Respawn, they are removed from the game and placed back in reserve and must be redeployed during the next round. When the character redeploys they do so with their original weapons, including one use weapons and equipment, and full hit points.

### Reactions

Some of the characters perks allow them to perform reactions. These work the same as abilities taken during an activation but happen during another characters activation. Simply follow the rules provided in the reaction to know when and how these work.

### Special Terrain

#### Teleport

If you wish you may include teleports in your battles, and these may be one or two-way. You will need a suitable piece of terrain for the teleport and a marker for it's destination. If you wish it to be two-way simply choose another teleport as the destination.

When a character moves into contact it may immediately be placed in contact with the target destination. It may continue it's movement from that point.

#### Launch Pads

Launch pads are similar to teleports in that they allow you to move your character around the battlefield more quickly than normal. However they do so by more directly launching the character through the air.

As with teleports you will need a suitable piece of terrain and a marker for the launch pads destination. The destination should be no more than 12 inches away and not blocked by any large terrain. Unlike teleports, when a character uses a launch pad they will lose 2 inches off their remaining movement and may only continue moving after the jump if they have movement left.

### Pick-ups

If you wish, you may include a number of pick-ups in your games. These are resources your character can collect that will improve their skills for the remainder of the round. There are 6 types of pickup, 3 have immediate effects while 3 provide a bonus that lasts a set amount of time.

If you wish to include to pick-ups in your game you should place 1-3 pick-up points on your battlefield. These should just be simple markers telling you where your pick-up will spawn. When a pick-up is available at a pick-up point you will need to place a token or dice at the point to indicate what kind of pick-up it is. At the start of each round, for each pick-up point that does not have a pick-up and does not have a character within 3 inches, roll a d6 to determine which pick-up has spawned and place it on the pick-up point.

To collect a pick-up a character must simply move into contact with it during their activation. Remove the marker from the pick-up point and apply the effects to the character.

| D6 Roll | Pick-up | Effect |
| :----: | :--- | :----- |
| 1 | Health | The character immediately recovers 1 lost Hit Point. |
| 2 | Adrenaline | The character immediately regains 1 Command Point |
| 3 | Resupply | Any "One use" weapon or equipment the character has that has been used is recovered and may be used again. |
| 4 | Shield | The character gains +1 to their Toughness until the end of their next activation. |
| 5 | Speed | The character gains +3 to it's Movement until the end of it's next activation. |
| 6 | Damage | The characters weapons have +1 Damage or +1 Piercing until the end of their current activation. |

### Objectives

Respawn uses Control objectives as detailed in the core rules as well as Flag objectives detailed below:

#### Flags

Flags are a special type of objective made up of two components, a flag marker and a flag base. Each team begins the base with their flag located on their flag base and their objective is to stop the enemy team from picking it up and returning it to their base. At the same time they will be trying to steal the enemy flag to return it to their own base.

Flag markers can be picked up by a character from an opposing team simply by moving across it. Once a character is carrying a flag they may not voluntarily put it back down. They may also only make Move or Advance actions. A flag is scored when the character carrying it moves into contact with their own base. At which point it is removed from the character and placed on the enemy base, at the end of the round it is returned to its original base.

If a character is killed while carrying a flag it is dropped where the character was last positioned. A member of the opposing team may pick the flag up from where it lies and continue to carry it to their base. If a member of the same team touches the flag it is immediately placed back at their base.

| Stasis | If a character loses any hit points to a Stasis weapon it may not move or advance for the remainder of the round. |
