title: Respawn
---

Respawn is a small team skirmish game that simulates the gameplay and mechanics found in online multiplayer shooters.

## Module Rules

Respawn is best played on a 2ft x 3ft or similar sized area. Each game of Respawn lasts for 4 rounds. Models in Respawn are referred to throughout as **Characters**.

### Respawn

When a character is killed in Respawn, they are removed from the game and placed back in reserve and must be redeployed during the next round. The character returns to the game with their original weapons, including one use weapons and equipment, and full hit points.

### Objectives

Respawn uses Control objectives as detailed in the core rules as well as Flag objectives detailed below:

#### Flags

Flags are a special type of objective made up of two components, a flag marker and a flag base. Each team begins the base with their flag located on their flag base and their objective is to stop the enemy team from picking it up and returning it to their base. At the same time they will be trying to steal the enemy flag to return it to their own base.

Flag markers can be picked up by a character from an opposing team simply by moving across it. Once a character is carrying a flag they may not voluntarily put it back down. They may also only make Move or Advance actions. A flag is scored when the character carrying it moves into contact with their own base. At which point it is removed from the character and placed on the enemy base, at the end of the round it is returned to its original base.

If a character is killed while carrying a flag it is dropped where the character was last positioned. A member of the opposing team may pick the flag up from where it lies and continue to carry it to their base. If a member of the same team touches the flag it is immediately placed back at their base.

## Creating a Team

Games of Respawn consist of 2 or more teams of an equal number of characters, games are best played with 3 characters per team for a quick game, 5 for a standard game, and 7 or more for large games. Games consisting of 10 or more total characters may require a larger battlefield.

To create a team you create your characters by choosing a class, choosing two perks from that class, weapon loadout, and one item of equipment. You may not take any perk more than twice in your team. You must choose different classes for each of your characters until you have at least one of each class

After you have created your characters you then choose a team perk that applies to every character in your team.

Every character begins with the following profile:

| Cmd | Mov | Skl | Def | Tgh | HP  |
