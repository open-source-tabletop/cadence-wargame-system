Scraplands Showdown is a post-apocalyptic vehicle racing and combat game. Each player assembles a team of vehicles, customised with upgrades, weapons, and armour, and competes to out-race and out-fight their opponents in a brutal Showdown.

## Module Rules

### Playing Scraplands Showdown

Scraplands Showdown is best played on a 3ft x 3ft or similar sized area.

The models in Scraplands represent ramshackle vehicles with makeshift weapons and armour. Models be around the 1:64 scale similar to die cast model cars are the best scale for this game. These models are referred to throughout this module as **cars**.

#### Racing

Most missions in Scraplands Showdown follow a race format. The terrain should be set up to form a loop track with a clear start and finish line. Players agree which direction the track flows and race to complete a set number of laps.

#### Race Initiative

In race format missions, models activate in a specific order as determined below:

- The car with the most Command Points remaining activates next.
- Cars with the same number of Command Points activate in order of race position. This is the vehicle that is furthest ahead on the track and furthest ahead in laps (i.e. the shortest distance to travel to complete the race).
- The car on the inside will activate before a car on the outside of the track in a tie.

#### Race Deployment

At the start of each Mission, the players will be required to place their cars on the table before the first round starts. Players roll-off then alternate placing their cars as instructed by the mission.

#### Finishing a Race

A race mission ends at the end of any round after which a vehicle has crossed the finish line on their final lap. The final positions of the cars are ranked from the car furthest past the finish line to the car furthest behind.

### Car Movement

#### Action: Move

Each time one of your cars performs a Move action it may move up to its Movement attribute in inches directly forward, or 1 inch backward, making 1 pivot of up to 45 degrees at any point during the action.

#### Action: Advance

When you perform an advance action you follow the same rules as above except that you must move up to your full Movement attribute directly forward making 1 pivot of up to 45 degrees at any point during the action. In addition you may increase your Movement attribute for this action by up to 6. For each additional inch you add you must roll a d6 before moving, for each 1 you roll you must make a control check as outlined below.

### Control Checks

At times you may be at risk of losing control of your car, when being attacked, pushing your speed, or colliding with the terrain. When asked to perform a control check you must make a Skill Roll. If you pass the Skill Roll nothing happens. If you fail the Skill Roll then the happens:

- If you are in contact with terrain or another car you take d6 hits, making Defence Rolls as normal for these. You take d6 hits regardless of how many cars or pieces of terrain you are in contact with.
- Any cars you are in contact with also take d6 hits, making Defence Rolls as normal.
- Your opponent may either rotate your vehicle up to 90 degrees or move you 1 inch in any direction. If this move brings you into contact with terrain or any cars not originally hit, these also take d6 hits.
