Scraplands Showdown is a post-apocalyptic vehicle racing and combat game. Each player assembles a team of cars, customised with upgrades, weapons, and armour, and competes to out-race and out-fight their opponents in a brutal Showdown.

## Module Rules

### Playing Scraplands Showdown

Scraplands Showdown is best played on a 3ft x 3ft or similar sized area.

The models in Scraplands represent ramshackle cars with makeshift weapons and armour. Models be around the 1:64 scale similar to die cast model cars are the best scale for this game. These models are referred to throughout this module as **cars**.

#### Racing

Most missions in Scraplands Showdown follow a race format. The terrain should be set up to form a loop track with a clear start and finish line. Players agree which direction the track flows and race to complete a set number of laps.

#### Race Initiative

In race format missions, models activate in a specific order as determined below:

- The car with the most Command Points remaining activates next.
- Cars with the same number of Command Points activate in order of race position. This is the car that is furthest ahead on the track and furthest ahead in laps (i.e. the shortest distance to travel to complete the race).
- The car on the inside will activate before a car on the outside of the track in a tie.

#### Race Deployment

At the start of each Mission, the players will be required to place their cars on the table before the first round starts. Players roll-off then alternate placing their cars as instructed by the mission.

#### Finishing a Race

A race mission ends at the end of any round after which a car has crossed the finish line on their final lap. The final positions of the cars are ranked from the car furthest past the finish line to the car furthest behind.

### Car Movement

#### Action: Move

Each time one of your cars performs a Move action it may move up to its Movement attribute in inches directly forward, or 1 inch backward, making 1 pivot of up to 45 degrees at any point during the action. You may not move over any other car at any time. If at any point during your move you move into base contact with another car your movement ends and both cars must make a control check. 

#### Action: Advance

When you perform an advance action you follow the same rules as above except that you must move up to your full Movement attribute directly forward making 1 pivot of up to 45 degrees at any point during the action. In addition you may increase your Movement attribute for this action by up to 6. For each additional inch you add you must roll a d6 before moving, for each 1 you roll you must make a control check as outlined below.

#### Action: Coasting

When activating a car with 1 Command Point, if you fail the test to use the Command Point you may move directly forward up to 2 inches instead of losing the Command Point.

### Control Checks

At times you may be at risk of losing control of your car, when being attacked, pushing your speed, or colliding with the terrain. When asked to perform a control check you must make a Skill Roll. If you pass the Skill Roll nothing happens. If you fail the Skill Roll then the following happens:

- If you are in contact with terrain or another car you take d6 hits, making Defence Rolls as normal for these. You take d6 hits regardless of how many cars or pieces of terrain you are in contact with.
- Any cars you are in contact with also take d6 hits, making Defence Rolls as normal.
- Your opponent may either rotate your car up to 90 degrees or move you 1 inch in any direction. If this move brings you into contact with terrain or any cars not originally hit, these also take d6 hits.
- If a control check causes your car to lose any hit points your activation immediately ends.

### Terrain

Terrain in Scraplands comes in the following types: Solid, Dangerous, Destructible.

#### Solid Terrain

Your car may not move over any terrain with the solid keyword. If any move you make brings you into contact with solid terrain your movement immediately ends and you make a control check. If you were making an Advance action you take 2 control checks instead.

#### Dangerous

If your car moves over dangerous terrain you roll 1 control check for every full inch you travel through it.

#### Destructible

Any terrain with the destructible keyword counts as having Defence of 3, Toughness of 3, and 1 Hit Point. If reduced to 0 Hit Points it is removed from the table.

## Building a Team

Players build their team by selecting a number of cars from the list below and upgrading them with weapons, armour, and abilities. When adding upgrades to a car you may not add more than 15 points to any individual car. Games of Scraplands Showdown are best played at 100-150 points.
