title: Scraplands Showdown

Scraplands Showdown is a post-apocalyptic vehicle racing and combat game. Each player assembles a team of cars, customised with upgrades, weapons, and armour, and competes to out-race and out-fight their opponents in a brutal Showdown.

## Module Rules

### Playing Scraplands Showdown

Scraplands Showdown is best played on a 3ft x 3ft or similar sized area set up to form a race track.

The models in Scraplands represent ramshackle cars with makeshift weapons and armour. Models around the 1:64 scale similar to die cast model cars are the best scale for this game. These models are referred to throughout this module as **cars**.

### Racing

Most missions in Scraplands Showdown follow a race format. The terrain should be set up to form a loop track with a clear start and finish line. Players agree which direction the track flows and race to complete a set number of laps.

#### Race Initiative

In race missions, models activate in a specific order as determined below:

- The car with the most Command Points remaining activates next.
- Cars with the same number of Command Points activate in order of race position. This is the car that is furthest ahead on the track and furthest ahead in laps (i.e. the shortest distance to travel to complete the race).
- The car on the inside will activate before a car on the outside of the track in a tie.

#### Race Deployment

At the start of each mission, the players will be required to place their cars on the table before the first round starts. Players roll-off then alternate placing their cars. The first player places a car touching, but behind, the starting line. The second car is then placed one inch behind the starting line, the next is placed 2 inches behind the start line and so on. The cars must be placed facing forward across the start line but may otherwise be placed anywhere along it. Alternatively, players may set up grid positions for the cars to be placed upon.

#### Finishing a Race

A race mission ends at the end of any round after which a car has crossed the finish line on their final lap. The final positions of the cars are ranked from the car furthest past the finish line to the car furthest behind.

### Arena Battles

Not all missions in Scraplands are races, as the cars may also take part in an Arena battle. These missions follow the normal rules for activation order and deployment.

### Car Movement

#### Action: Move

Each time one of your cars performs a Move action it may move up to its Movement attribute in inches directly forward, or 1 inch backward, making 1 pivot of up to 45 degrees at any point during the action. You may not move over any other car at any time.

If at any point during your move you move into base contact with another car your movement ends and both cars must make a control check as explained below. If you take a Move action whilst in contact with another car, you must pivot so that you can move away from the vehicle, this does not cause a control check.

#### Action: Advance

When you perform an Advance action you follow the same rules as above except that you must move up to your full Movement attribute directly forward making 1 pivot of up to 45 degrees at any point during the action.

In addition you may increase your Movement attribute for this action. You may add 2 inches to your Movement attribute and may do this up to 5 times, declaring this before moving. For each additional 2 inches added you must roll a d6 before moving, for each 1 you roll you must make a control check as outlined below.

#### Action: Coasting

When activating a car with 1 Command Point, if you fail the test to use the Command Point you may make a Move Action but only moving up to 2 inches directly forward instead of losing the Command Point.

### Dodging

When a car moves into contact with you you may choose to dodge them by spending a Command Point. If you do so you are not required to make a control check and may move your car up to 1 inch in any direction so long as it doesn't bring you into contact with another car or any terrain.

### Control Checks

At times you may be at risk of losing control of your car; when being attacked, pushing your speed, or colliding with the terrain. When asked to perform a control check you must make a Skill Roll. If you pass the Skill Roll nothing happens. If you fail the Skill Roll then the following happens:

- Take d6 hits, making Defence Rolls as normal for these. You take d6 hits regardless of how many cars or pieces of terrain you are in contact with.
- If a control check causes your car to lose any hit points your activation immediately ends and your opponent may either rotate your car up to 45 degrees or move you 1 inch in any direction. If this move brings you into contact with terrain or any cars not originally hit this will trigger additional control checks.

### Terrain

Terrain in Scraplands comes in the following types: Solid, Dangerous, Destructible, and Ramps.

#### Solid Terrain

Your car may not move over any terrain with the solid keyword. If any move you make brings you into contact with solid terrain your activation immediately ends and you make a control check. If you were making an Advance action you make 2 control checks instead.

#### Dangerous

If your car moves over dangerous terrain you roll 1 control check for each move or advance action that includes moving through the terrain.

#### Destructible

Any terrain with the destructible keyword counts as having Defence of 3, Toughness of 3, and 1 Hit Point. If reduced to 0 Hit Points it is removed from the table.

#### Ramps

Ramps are a special type of terrain that allow your car to make spectacular jumps across other cars or terrain.

A ramp should have a clear entry line where it begins and can be moved onto, and an end where the car will exit from. A car must move onto a ramp through the entry line and have enough remaining movement to move entirely past the ramp. Moving into a ramp in any other way is treated as solid terrain.

If the car moves so that it leaves the ramp through the correct exit line it adds 2 inches to it's remaining movement and may ignore intervening terrain object of height 1 and other cars that are entirely within 6 inches of the ramp. At the end of the movement the car takes a control check.

If the car moves off the ramp through any part not the correct exit it will complete it's move as normal, colliding with any cars or terrain as normal. If it does not have enough movement to be placed in a clear area of terrain the car is wrecked, and removed from the game.

## Building a Team

Players build their team by selecting a number of cars from the list below and upgrading them with weapons, armour, and abilities. When adding upgrades to a car you may not add more points of upgrades than the initial cost of the car. Games of Scraplands Showdown are best played at 150 and 200 points.
