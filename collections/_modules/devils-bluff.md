### A Bad Hand

In the heart of the rugged Arizona landscape, where the sun beats down upon the scorched earth and the winds carry tales of both despair and hope, there lies a town—a town known as Barton's Bluff. Nestled away from the prying eyes of the lawmen and the watchful gaze of the righteous, this once-promising settlement has become a haven for darkness and deceit.

Barton's Bluff, named after the towering bluff that looms over its outskirts, was once a place of promise. With fertile farmland stretching as far as the eye could see and rich veins of coal hidden deep within the surrounding hills, the prospect of wealth and prosperity seemed within reach. But alas, the pursuit of profit and power came at a heavy cost.

Unscrupulous landowners, wealthy mine operators, and cunning casino magnates set their sights on Barton's Bluff, their insatiable greed casting a long shadow over the town. The people, weary and downtrodden, began to refer to their home as Devil's Bluff—a testament to the evil that had taken root.

Recognizing the depths of despair that had befallen their town, the local priest orchestrated a gathering—a meeting of the minds within the sacred walls of the church. Heads of the factions, along with their trusted lieutenants, assembled in this unlikely sanctuary, seeking an end to the misery that gripped Barton's Bluff.

But fate had other plans.

As the discussions reached their crescendo, the very foundations of the town shuddered beneath the weight of their collective sins. The earth itself rebelled, shaking the very core of Devil's Bluff. Chaos erupted as the bluff crumbled, swallowing the church and its ill-fated occupants into the depths below.

### Playing the cards you're dealt

When the dust settled and the echoes of the catastrophe subsided, a new chapter dawned upon Barton's Bluff—one of opportunity and treacherous ambition. The high and mighty had fallen, silenced by the cruel hand of fate. A power vacuum emerged, leaving the workers, the small-time gangs, the hired thugs, and the few righteous souls to vie for control over the remnants of the fractured town.

Each faction harbored its own desires—for power, for wealth, for the restoration of law and order. It is within this crucible of chaos and possibility that you, courageous player, shall step forward. Choosing a gang, embracing a cause, and setting your sights on the destiny of Devil's Bluff, you shall carve your name into the annals of this lawless land.

In Devil's Bluff, the cards are dealt, and the stakes are high. The struggle for control has just begun, and only the boldest and most cunning shall prevail. Will you seize the reins of power, forge a path of righteousness, or simply revel in the spoils of this forsaken town?

The time has come to make your mark, to shape the destiny of Devil's Bluff. The Wild West awaits, and the showdown is nigh.
