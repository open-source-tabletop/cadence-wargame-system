Welcome to Guilds and Glory, a cooperative game where players embark on epic narrative fantasy campaigns. As members of The Guild of Adventurers, players fight fierce battles against monsters, delve into treacherous dungeons, and uncover hidden treasures. Working together is crucial to success, as players face tough decisions and thrilling challenges that will test their courage and strategic thinking.

## Module Rules

### The Grid

Guilds and Glory uses inch square grids for all movement and measuring.

#### Grid Movement

Models move 1 square instead of 1 inch when moving and may only move orthogonally (in straight,  or diagonal lines). A model must always be placed wholly within a square. Models that are too big for one square must either take up 2 squares in a row or 4 squares in a block. When moving these models they still move 1 square for each point of movement. If a model with a rectangular footprint wishes to rotate, choose one of the squares it occupies as the point to rotate around, using 1 inch of movement any time it rotates to occupy a new square.

#### Battlefield

Different adventures may require a broad range of terrain. If you do not wish to make or buy terrain having an inch grid mat around 2ft by 2ft that you can draw basic terrain on will work for most games.
