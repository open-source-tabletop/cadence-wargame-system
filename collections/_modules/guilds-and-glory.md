## Overview

### The Adventurers and the Overlord

In Guilds and Glory, one player (or a group of players) controls a party of 4 heroes, members of the Guild of Adventurers, who have been hired for a dangerous job. Each campaign will see these adventurers face several battles as they fight towards a final showdown. Another player takes the role of the Overlord, controlling hordes of monsters and minions as they try to thwart the adventurers at every turn. The Overlord is also responsible for running the game, including relating the narrative elements and any events that happen within the game.

### Asymmetric Play

This game is designed to be asymmetric, with the focus of the story being the goals of the adventurers. While the game is intended to be balanced in each battle, it is ultimately designed to allow the adventurers to try again until they prevail against the Overlord. This does not mean that the Overlord player should allow the adventurers to win, rather that their role is that of the storyteller and antagonist, similar to the role of a Dungeon Master in roleplaying games.

### Battlefield

Different campaigns may require a broad range of terrain and you will usually need a battlefield around 2ft by 2ft. If you do not wish to make or buy terrain, having a surface you can draw basic terrain on will work for most games. When using terrain like this you need to imagine that any walls or obscuring terrain extends vertically up from the board when checking line of sight.

## Gameplay

### Initiative

In Guilds and Glory, regardless of the number of players, the adventurers are treated as a single player for initiative purposes. This means the adventurers and the Overlord roll off at the start of each round to determine which has the initiative. In addition, either side must always choose the model with the most Command Points remaining to activate next. If there are multiple models that have the same number then the player can decide which to activate, or roll-off if there are multiple players in the adventurers.

### Minion Groups

When the Overlord has multiple models of the same type, ie. taken from the same unit profile, these always activate as a group. When the Overlord choses one of these models they must activate each model in the group. This may be done in any order the Overlord wishes.

If the Overlord has more than 4 models in a group they must be split into two groups. It is worth noting that these models are not a unit and do not activate together and perform the same actions.

### Attacks

Unless otherwise stated, all weapons are assumed to have the Arc (front) special rule. Models making an attack against another model from their rear arc gain +1 to their weapons Piercing attribute. When a model moves within 1 inch of an enemy model it may make a free pivot to face that model.

### Strength

Models in Guilds and Glory have a Strength attribute. This is typically used as a value in a weapons Damage attribute, where you substitute the abbreviation Str for the models strength.

### Keywords

Both models and weapons may include specific keywords, these typically represent certain aspects of their nature, such as being "evil", "wild", or "magic". These keywords do not confer any special rule on their own but are instead used to determine how they interact with other rules. A weapon may specify that it does additional damage to Undead models for example, or a model may be immune to Fire weapons.

### Status Effects

During a game, models may be affected by various effects such as being stunned or poisoned. This typically occurs as a result of being hit by a weapon or spell, and applies an effect to the hit model. As these effects are temporary, it is recommended to use tokens to represent them, which can be placed next to the affected model. Unless otherwise indicated, a model suffering from a status effect rolls a d6 at the end of their activation, on a roll of a 2+ the effect is removed.

Status   | Effect
:------- | :-----
Blinded  | This model must re-roll successful Attack Rolls.
Burning  | This model takes d6 Fire damage at the start of it's next activation, it may make Defence Rolls as normal.
Fear     | This model must spend an additional Command Point to move closer to an enemy model or to make an Attack action.
Poisoned | This model has a -1 modifier to its Movement and Toughness unless they have Immunity (Poison)
Slowed   | This model may only move 1 space during a Move or Advance action.
Stunned  | This model may only take 1 action on it's next activation.

### Reactions

Some of the models may have special rules that allow them to perform reactions. These work the same as abilities but happen outside of the models activation. Simply follow the rules provided in the reaction to know when and how these work.

### Downed Adventurers

When one of the adventurer models are reduced to 0 hit points, instead of being removed as a casualty, they are either placed on their side or marked as downed using a token. They have been knocked unconcious or otherwise incapacitated. At the start of each new round they can make a Death Save: roll a d6 for the model, on a roll of a 3+ they recover 1 hit point and return to play with no Command Points, otherwise they are removed as a casualty for now. If they have a friendly model within 1 inch and no enemy models within 1 inch, they may re-roll this dice. At the end of the game the adventurers will check to see what happens to the character.

## Managing Your Party

Throughout the course of a campaign, your will need to track your party as characters level up, get injured or replaced, or as equipment gets used or added to your inventory.

### Character Level

Adventurer characters in Guilds and Glory can grow and become more powerful over time, determined by their Level. A character begins at Level 1 and the maximum they can reach is Level 10. In the game this is managed very simply, a campaign will tell you what level your characters should be to start and under what circumstances they gain a level. Each time a character moves up a level they gain a new perk: the characters in the "Legends of the Guild" have these prepared for you, while the "Book of Origins" shows you how to choose new ones.

### Death and Injury

If a model is removed from a battle as a casualty you must check to see what happens to them after the game. Roll a D6 for each casualty. On a roll of a 3+ they make a full recovery. On a roll of a 2 they recover but take an injury - they drop a level and lose one of their perks. On a roll of a 1 they have died and must be replaced. If any of the characters have any healing potions in their inventory they may remove 1 to automatically pass this test.

To replace a character the players should create a new character that is 1 level lower than the lowest level character in their party. 

### Equipment and Inventory

Each of your characters require have weapons, armour, and equipment as outlined in their profile, or chosen when creating them. In addition your party may spend up to 50 Gold on additional supplies before starting a campaign - this is the adventurers inventory and you must decide which characters are carrying which items. You may change this at the before starting the first round of any game in the campaign.

Different campaigns may offer additional special items that you may purchase in addition to the following standard items:

| Item | Effect | Cost |
