Halo Firefight is a fan made game module set in the Halo universe that allows you to enact battles from any era in the Halo timeline.

> "In the 26th century, humankind has colonized hundreds of worlds in Earth's interstellar neighborhood, only to stumble upon a hostile alliance of aliens known as the Covenant. Motivated by the Prophets' promises of ascension to godhood in the form of the eponymous Halos, a series of ring-shaped superweapons built by the ancient race of the Forerunners, the Covenant are bent on humanity's destruction. With the apocalyptic Human-Covenant War concluded, members of both sides are faced with an uncertain future in a politically complex environment of numerous different factions and affiliations, while ancient Forerunner entities and technologies continue to involve themselves with the galaxy's affairs."

## Module Rules

### Playing Halo Firefight

Halo Firefight is best played on a battlefield around 3ft by 4ft or larger and is designed for 28mm, individually based miniatures.

### Building an Army

Building an army for Halo Firefight simply requires choosing the units you wish to use from any of the provided army lists, adding up the points to an agreed total for each model, their weapons, and equipment. Small games are typically played at 100 points, standard games at 200 points, and large games from 300. There are no restrictions to which models you may use and it is up to players to agree on what would make a satisfying battle.

### Special Rules

The following special rules are used in Halo Firefight games:

| Special Rule | Effect |
| :----------- | :----- |
| Active Camo | When a model targets this model for an attack from more than 6 inches away, it must roll a d6 first. On a roll of a 6 it is able to make the attack. All attacks against this model suffer -1 to their Attack Rolls. If this model is hit by any attacks it loses the Active Camo rule for the remainder of the round. |
| Dual Wield (X) | If a model is equipped with two of these weapons it may add X to the Attacks attribute. |
| Weak Point (Arc) | This model counts as having a Toughness of 1 against attacks in the specified Arc. |
