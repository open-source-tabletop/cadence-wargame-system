Cadence System - Core Rules
===========================

Version 0.1

## Introduction

Welcome to the Cadence System, a free, community owned wargaming ruleset designed to open up a world of wargaming possibilities. These core rules provide the foundation upon which any number of games can be created, you will find a range of pre-written modules and expansions to play or you can create your own game using the system.

Section 1 - Basic Rules
=======================

## Dice

Cadence uses six sided dice, written as "d6", to determine the outcome of many actions and there are a few ways these are used. The most common is in an action roll, such as an attack roll to see if a weapon hits an enemy unit. action rolls are always based on a single d6, though you may make many action rolls at the same time, where each dice must score equal to or above a target number to count as a success, with anything below the target being a failure.

Action rolls often have modifiers applied to them making the roll either easier or more difficult. The modifiers may affect the roll to where it would automatically succeed or automatically fail regardless of the value rolled. A roll of a 1 always counts as a failure regardless of modifiers, however a modifier that automatically fails still counts as a failure regardless of the number rolled.

You may also be asked to "roll-off" against other players. In this case both players roll a number of d6 equal to the number of players in the roll-off with the winner being the player with the highest combined result. In the case of a tie players should roll-off again until they have unique results.

Unless otherwise instructed, your dice rolls should be done in full view of all players with enough time for them to see the results.

Rules that allow you re-roll a dice only allow that dice to be re-rolled once, regardless of how many rules permit it to be re-rolled. If you re-roll a dice you must accept the new result even if it is worse.

Six sided dice are also used in the game to mark a unit's remaining actions and hit points. In this case the dice are not rolled but instead the top face of the dice represents the value. In practice this means you will need at least 3 colours of six sided dice to avoid mixing up these uses on the tabletop.

## Distance and Measuring

Measuring is another key part of the game, whether checking if a unit is in range for an attack, or seeing how far they travel when moving. Cadence uses inches for all distances and you will need a ruler marked in inches to play. When you measure the distance to or from a model you always do so from the closest point on it's base. You may measure any distance at any time so long as doing so does not interfere with the actions of your opponent or unnecessarily slow down the game.

It is important to remember that a model or object is "within" a certain distance if any part of it is closer than the specified distance.

## Armies

In Cadence, each player has a selection of miniatures that represent their army. This can vary depending on the module you choose but will usually include a range of units, such as infantry, vehicles, or monsters, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Every model in a player's army is considered friendly, all the models in your opponent's army are considered enemies.

## Units and Models

To avoid confusion there are some terms relating to your miniatures which have specific meaning within the game. While you may find modules using a wide variety of miniatures in many different scales, a **model** is a miniature, or group of miniatures, which are mounted on a single base or are otherwise connected. If a model does not have a base, such as is sometimes the case with large vehicle or monster miniatures, it must have a clear footprint to count as the base within the game.

Units are groupings of 1 or more models within the game. Some modules will group several models together, like soldiers in a squad, others will have each unit contain only a single model. All models must belong to exactly one unit.

### Profiles and Attributes

In order to play a game, you need to know which models you can use and what they can do on the battlefield. Each module will contain relevant unit profiles, often organised into army lists, that give you all the information you need for your units.

A unit profile has the following information:

- The unit's name.
- The unit configuration, explaining which models it includes and which weapons and equipment.
- Model attributes for each model in the unit, some modules may list these separately.
- Special rules that apply to the unit.
- Any abilities the unit has.

### Attributes

Each model in Cadence has a set of attributes that tell you how well it can perform various actions, these are:

- Command (Cmd): The number of actions this model can perform each round.
- Movement (Mov): The number of inches this model can travel during a move action:
- Skill (Skl): The model's ability with it's weapons.
- Defence (Def): The model's armour or ability to negate attacks.
- Toughness (Tgh): How much damage the model can take for each of it's hit points.
- Hit Points (HP): How much damage the model can take before being destroyed.

### Special Rules

Special rules modify how the model operates within the game. Some special rules are universal and are included in this book, these are typically given simply by name in a unit profile. Others are unique to a module, army, or model, and will be provided in the unit's profile or army list.

### Abilities

Abilities are like actions that are unique to a unit. These work like normal actions and the details of how they work, along with any requirements or restrictions, will be given in a unit's profile.

### Unit Formation

Units consisting of more than one model must stay within close proximity of each other during a battle, known as being "in formation". A unit is in formation when the distance between each model forms a chain connecting all the models with a gap between each model no larger than 3 inches. Every time you activate a unit, after you move each of your models, the unit must finish that action in formation.

It is possible for your unit to become out of formation during another units activation, by losing models as they are destroyed for example. If this happens, the next time the unit activates it must immediately make a move action to restore being in formation. If it cannot be resume being in formation after it's move action the unit is destroyed and removed from the game.

### Direction

Every model in Cadence has a forward facing direction, typically the direction the miniature is facing but if this is not obvious you should agree with your opponent or mark a point on the model's base. By extension there is also an opposite backwards facing for the model.

In addition a model divides the battlefield into two zones: it's front and rear arcs. Draw a line through the center of your model at a right angle to the forward facing, everything in front of that line is considered the front arc with everything behind that line considered the rear arc. A model or object is in the front arc if any part of it is within the front arc.

## Weapons

In order to fight, your models require weapons and these will be listed in your unit profile. Weapons have their own set of attributes which are usually provided in your module or army list. These are:

- Range (Rng): The distance the weapon can make an attack up to.
- Attacks (Att): The volume or intensity of the attacks from the weapon.
- Damage (Dmg): The damage each successful hit from the weapon inflicts.
- Piercing (Prc): The weapons ability to negate armour.
- Special Rules that apply to the weapon.

### Missions

When you play a game of Cadence you will typically choose a mission to play, this is a set of rules for how to set up your table, how armies will be deployed, and what the goal of the mission will be. A simple mission might simply see two armies fight to wipe out the oppoising army, but most provide a range of objectives that provide different goals for the players to achieve. There are 3 simple missions included in the Advance Rules section of this book with more available in modules, you should also feel free to create your own.

### Victory Points

In order to win a battle, players are awarded Victory Points throughout the game according to the mission they are playing. The player with the most Victory Points is the winner.

### Objective Markers

Objectives are a key component of most missions, small markers that represent key points on the battlefield: such as resources to be collected, equipment to be destroyed, or zones to be controlled. An objective marker is typically a 40mm circle, though small models or other appropriate objects can be used for a more thematic experience. Objectives come in 4 types, each of which can first be secured, or controlled by a unit, and then scored, when they award points according to a mission.

Objectives are secured using the "Secure" action when a unit is within 1 inch of the objective marker. If no other enemy units are within 3 inches of the objective marker then the marker may be secured. The unit attempting to secure an objective must make a successful Secure Roll, rolliing a d6 and scoring 4 or higher, to secure the objective.

Objectives can be one of the following four types:

- **Control**: Once a control objective is secured, it remains secured so long as at least 1 unit from the securing army stays within 1 inch of the objective.
- **Destroy**: Once a player has secured this objective it must remain secured until the end of the next round at which point it is destroyed and removed from the battlefield.
- **Access**: Once this objective is secured it is scored at the end of that round and then removed from the game. Access objectives cannot be secured on the first round.
- **Recover**: Once this objective is secured the unit that secured it must survive until the end of the battle to score any victory points from it. If the unit that secured the objective is destroyed the objective is destroyed.

### Entry Points

When you begin the first round of a game you begin with all of your units off the table "in reserve". To be able to deploy your units you have a number of markers called Entry Points that you will be instructed to set up on the table, typically along a table edge. This is covered in more detail in Section 2.

### Mission Parameters

When choosing your mission each will provide a list of Mission Parameters, detailing some or all of the following information:

- Any rules for setting up the terrain on your table.
- The number and type of objectives to be placed on your table.
- The conditions under which players will score Victory Points.
- The placement of Entry Points, used for deploying your units onto the battlefield.

Section 2 - Playing the Game
============================

## Structure of a Game

Cadence is broken down into easy to follow stages and steps, these are as follows:

### Stage 1: Setup

Stage 1 is a few simple steps to set up your battlefield ready to play.

1. Choose a Mission
2. Set Up Terrain
3. Set Up Markers
4. Put Armies into Reserve

### Stage 2: Battle

Stage 2 is played in a series of rounds with the following steps each round:

1. Roll For Initiative
2. Place Command Dice
3. Players Alternate Activations
4. Score Victory Points

## Setup

### Choosing A Mission

The first step in setting up your game is to choose a mission to play. Every game of Cadence is played using a mission that provides a set of parameters that outline the setup of your board, the length of the game, the victory conditions for the battle, and other relevant information. There are 3 basic missions included in the Advanced Rules sections with more available from modules, you should also feel free to create your own.

### Set Up Terrain

Your chosen mission may include some guidance on setting up your terrain but most will allow you to set up your terrain from your collection as you see fit. Try to include a mix of terrain such as large line of sight blocking elements and smaller, cover-providing scatter pieces. If one player sets up all the terrain, then the other player should be provided an opportunity to modify the setup.

### Set Up Markers

Set up any Objective Markers and Entry Points according to your Mission Parameters.

### Put Armies into Reserve

Once you have your battlefield set up you are almost ready to begin the battle. Place all the units that will be used in the game near the table so that both players can see which units each player is using, and which units are already deployed as the game progresses.

## Battle

### Rounds

The battle stage of a game of Cadence is played through a number of rounds, during which players will be able to activate their units to move and fight. Unless otherwise specified a game of Cadence lasts for 4 rounds.

### Roll for Initiative

At the start of each new round players should roll-off, the player that rolls the highest has the initiative this round and will have the first activation.

### Place Command Dice

Every unit in your army will need a Command Dice, a d6 in a different colour from those you roll or mark hit points with, placed next to it at the start of a new round. Each dice should be placed with the top face showing the unit's Command attribute, this is the unit's Command Points for this round. On the first turn this should also be done for each unit that you have in reserve.

### Alternate Activations

Once players have placed all of their Command Dice they can begin taking turns, starting with the player that won the initiative, to activate one of their units.

Players choose one of their units that still has Command Points, these are then spent to perform a number of actions from the selection below. Once the player has performed all the actions it wishes to they then pass, allowing the other player to then activate one of their units.

This will continue until the players have used all of the Command Points on all of their units. If one player has no units remaining to activate then play automatically returns to the other player until all players have finished.

#### Deploying From Reserve

As your units do not begin on the battlefield they must be deployed from reserve. When it is your turn to activate a unit you may choose a unit already on the battlefield or one in reserve. If you choose a unit in reserve it is placed up to it's Movement attribute in inches from one of your Entry Points and then activates as normal. This does not count as having taken a Move action and can be done before declaring your actions for that unit.

Some restrictions apply to deploying your models from reserve:

- Unless another rule permits it, each player must deploy all of their units on the battlefield during the first turn.
- If a unit cannot be placed within range of an entry point then it cannot be deployed. If it must be deployed but cannot be placed then it is destroyed.
- If a round ends with a player having no units on the battlefield, even if they still have some in reserve, then that player immediately forfeits the game.

## Actions

When you activate a unit you first declare a number of actions and the order you will perform them, then pay the appropriate cost from the unit's Command Points (a unit must have enough points to perform your chosen actions). You do not have to spend all of a unit's Command Points when you activate it, allowing you to activate it again later in the round, however there are some restrictions:

- You must spend at least 2 Command Points per activation, unless your unit has only 1 Command Point remaining.
- You may only spend a maximum of 4 Command Points per activation.
- You may only perform each action once per activation.
- If you start your activation with only 1 Command Point available, roll a d6, on a roll of a 1 this last Command Point is lost. This still counts as your activation.

### Move

When you take a Move action each model in your unit can be moved up to it's Movement attribute in inches. Each model in the unit is moved according to the rules outlined below and the unit must finish this action in formation.

When moving a model always measure from the same point on the base to ensure no part of the model moves more than the allowed distance. Models should always be moved in a straight line along their forward facing but may be pivoted on the spot as often as needed.

There are some points to remember when moving:

- A model may not move over the base of any enemy models but may move over the base of a friendly model so long as it can finish it's movement without any bases overlapping.
- A model may not be moved out of the boundary of your battlefield.

#### Terrain

When you move your models they will often find different types of terrain in their path, most of which they will have to move around as they cannot pass through it.

There are several types of terrain that can affect how your models move and these are covered in the Advanced Rules section later in this book.

### Advance

An Advance action follows the same rules as a Move action but must be taken immediately after a Move Action.

### Attack

When a unit takes an attack action you begin by declaring which models in your unit will target which enemy units and which weapons you will be using. A model that has more than one weapon may only use one when making an attack. You may choose different targets for each of your models in a unit.

If you have any enemy units within 1 inch of your unit you must choose one of those as your target.

Before rolling any dice for the attack you need to determine if you have line of sight to your target, if they are in range, and if they are a valid target. You may change which models are targeting which units while checking this but once you start rolling dice for an attack you may no longer change any of your targets.

#### Line of Sight

For each target unit you determine your line of sight through any model in your unit that is targeting that unit. Check, from the perspective of that model (i.e. by bending down and looking through the model), to see if it can see models in the enemy unit. The result of this check will be either clear, obstructed, or blocked.

You can ignore intervening models in the attacking and target units when determining line of sight.

- If you can see at least 1 model completely unobstructed in the target unit then you have a clear line of sight to that unit.
- If you can see at least 1 model in the target unit, but every model you can see is at least partially obscured by terrain, then you have an obstructed line of sight.
- If any of the models in the enemy unit are partially obscured by another unit, or if you cannot see any of the models in the enemy unit, then you have a blocked line of sight.

#### Check Range

For every model in your attacking unit you need to check that it is in range to their chosen target. Measure the distance between that model and the nearest model in the target unit. If it is equal to or less than the weapon's range attribute the model is in range and may perform an attack.

#### Attack Procedure

Once you have determined your targets and line of sights you follow the attack procedure outlined below. You can follow this procedure for each model in your unit or you can combine attacks from each model with the same Skill value using the same weapon to speed up the process. Repeat the process until you have made all of your attacks.

#### Step 1 - Attack Rolls

To determine if each attack hits the target unit you make a number of Attack Rolls equal to the attacks attribute of the weapon being used. An Attack Roll is a d6 roll trying to equal or beat the attacking model's Skill attribute. If multiple models are attacking with the same weapon against the same unit you may roll the combined number of these attacks together. Each succesful roll is considered a hit.

- **Close Range Penalty**: Many ranged weapons are not designed for use at extremely short range, when making an attack against a target unit that is within 1 inch of your unit (not the individual model) your Attack Roll counts as having a Skill of 6. Weapons with the Assault special rule do not suffer this penalty.
- **Height Advantage**: When making an Attack Roll against a target at a lower height level, as explained in the section on terrain, you gain a +1 to your Attack Roll.
- **Obscured Penalty**: When making an Attack Roll against a target with an obscured Line of Sight you suffer a -1 to your Attack Roll.

#### Step 3 - Roll Defence

For each successful hit against a target unit that player must make a number of Defence Rolls equal to the Damage attribute of the weapon being used. A Defence Roll is a d6 roll trying to score equal or higher than that unit's Defence attribute. This Defence Roll is reduced by the attacking weapons Piercing attribute.

Each failed Defence Roll is 1 point of damage.

#### Step 3 - Apply Damage

When a unit takes damage it loses 1 hit point for every amount of damage that equals it's Toughness attribute. So a unit with a Toughness of 1 will lose 1 hit point for every point of damage, where a unit with a Toughness of 3 would lose 1 hit point for every 3 points of damage it takes. Any excess damage that is insufficient to lose another hit point is discarded.

For each lost hit point the target unit's owner chooses any model in that unit, except the leader unless it is the only model remaining, to have it's hit points reduced. If that model is reduced to 0 hit points it is destroyed, remove it from the game and select another model. Continue doing this until you have assigned all the lost hit points to models or until every model in the unit has been removed.

If a model loses hit points, but is not reduced to 0, place a die next to the model showing how many hit points it has remaining. If your unit takes damage and has a model that has already taken damage in a previous attack, you must assign any new damage to that model first. In this way a unit will only ever require one dice to display remaining hit points.

### Ability (Variable Cost)

An ability is a unique action that some units possess. The details of any ability, along with the associated Command Point cost, will be listed in the unit's profile, army list, or module.

### Secure

When a unit wishes to secure an objective they take a Secure action. They must be within 1 inch of the objective marker and no other enemy units can be within 3 inches of the objective marker. The unit attempting to secure an objective must make a successful Secure Roll, rolliing a d6 and scoring 4 or higher, to secure the objective.

Section 3 - Advanced Rules
==========================

## Terrain

A model cannot move through terrain objects and instead must move around them or over them following the rules for different kinds of terrain. To understand how your terrain works the game uses a simple system of keywords. A keyword may apply to a whole piece of terrain or to specific parts of your terrain. Make sure all players know which keywords apply to the terrain before playing. The following keywords can be applied to different parts of your terrain to define how they work in the game:

#### Keyword: Clear

This keyword applies to any area on your terrain on which models can be placed and move as normal, this is usually for walkways, the tops of hills and so on. Terrain is only clear if the model can be securely placed on it, if a model has a base that is too large or is otherwise restricted then the terrain is considered impassable.

#### Keyword: Climbable

Climbable usually refers to an area of vertical terrain that connects two different height levels or that can be climbed over. Models can move up climbable terrain at the cost of 1 inch of their allowed movement for each level ascended. Models may climb down climbable terrain at the cost of 1 inch of their allowed movement for every 2 full levels descended (so climbing down 1 level is free). Models may only climb up or down if they have sufficient movement to complete their movement on clear terrain or on an unobstructed area of the battlefield.

#### Keyword: Impassable

Models cannot climb over or move through this piece of terrain.

#### Keyword: Rough

Terrain with the barrier keyword may be moved across at the cost of 1 inch of allowed movement, in addition to the distance travelled, however models may not finish their movement on a barrier.

#### Keyword: Cover

Units that are targeted for an attack that gain an obscured line of sight through this terrain gain a +1 to their Defence Rolls.

### Height Levels

When you have terrain that has different height levels, you should assign each clear area a height level, typically a battlefield will have only 1 or 2 height levels. The lowest level is always considered height 0 and each height level counting up is typically around 1-2 inches difference. Models may only ascend height levels where there is climbable terrain that connects the two height levels.

If you have terrain that is different levels but not any significant change then it should be the same height level as the nearest area, allowing models to freely move across small changes.

## Universal Special Rules

Special rules are a set of modifiers to how models operate within the game. The rules presented here are universal and will usually only be included in a unit profile by name. 

Some special rules have a value indicated in their title, such as Heavy Armour (X), where X can be different values for each unit. When a unit has this rule it will be given with a value in place of the X, substitute this value in the text of the special rule.

| Unit Special Rules | Details |
| ------------------ | ------- |
| Flying | Models with this rule are not affected by intervening terrain or models when they move, so long as they finish their move in an allowed position. These models ignore any penalties for changing height levels. |
| Heavy Armour (X) | Reduce the piercing value of attacks made against this unit it by X to a minimum of 0. |
| Non-Scoring | This unit cannot secure objectives. |
| Resilient | This model may re-roll any failed defence rolls that roll a 1. |
| Rugged | This model ignores the penalty for travelling through rough terrain. |
| Skilled | This unit may re-roll any attack rolls that roll a 1. |
| Stealth | Attacks against this model from more than 12 inches away suffer -1 to their Attack Rolls. |
| Support | Models with this rule do not need to be deployed on the first turn and may instead be held in reserve in subsequent turns. These models must be deployed in the second or third turn. |

| Weapon Special Rules | Details |
| -------------------- | ------- |
| Accurate | When making an attack with this weapon your attack roll has a +1 modifier. |
| Assault | This weapon does not suffer from the Close Range Penalty when making attacks. |
| Heavy | A unit must spend an additional Command Point to use this weapon. |
| Indirect | Attacks with this weapon count an obscured line of sight as clear. |
| One Use | This weapon may only be used once per battle. |
| Rending (X) | Weapons with this rule automatically cause additional X damage when the attack roll is a 6. |
| Torrent | An attack with this weapon hits on any attack roll that is not a 1. |

## Example Missions

### Mission 1

#### Entry Points

Players roll off and choose opposing table edges, if using a rectangular table these should be the long table edges. Players alternate placing 1 entry point for every full 12 inches of length for their table edge - these can be placed anywhere on this table edge.

#### Objectives

**Primary Objective**: Place 1 'Destroy' objective in the center of the table. 

**Secondary Objectives**: Along the centre line of the table, between the 2 players, place 2 'Control' objectives on either side of the Primary Objective, halfway between the edge of the table and the centre so that all 3 objectives form a line between the players.

#### Victory Points

The Primary Objective is worth a number of Victory Points equal to the turn number it is destroyed.

Each Secondary Objective is worth 1 Victory Point at the end of each round it is secured and an additional 1 Victory Point if the Primary Objective has not been destroyed.

### Mission 2

#### Entry Points

Players roll off and choose opposing table edges, if using a rectangular table these should be the short table edges. Players alternate placing 1 entry point for every full 12 inches of length for their table edge - these can be placed anywhere on this table edge.

#### Objectives

**Primary Objectives**: Each player must place 4 'Access' objective on their side of the table so that they are at least 6 inches from any table edge and any other objective. 

#### Victory Points

Players may only secure the objectives placed by their opponent. Each objective is worth 1 Victory Point.

### Mission 3

#### Entry Points

Players roll off and choose opposing table edges. Players alternate placing 1 entry point for every full 12 inches of length for their table edge - these can be placed anywhere on this table edge.

#### Objectives

**Primary Objectives**: Place one 'Control' objective in the centre of the board. 

**Secondary Objectives**: Place 4 'Recover' objectives around the primary objective half way between the center of the board and each of the 4 corners. 

#### Victory Points

The Primary Objective is worth 4 Victory Points at the end of round 1, 3 Victory Points at the end of round 2, and 2 Victory Points for all remaining rounds.

The Secondary Objectives are each worth 2 Victory Points for being secured at the end of the game.
