Cadence is, at it's simplest, a set of wargaming rules: describing how you would move and attack with models on the tabletop. However, it is how these rules are utilised to make unique games, and how these rules are developed and licensed, that makes Cadence what it is.

### A game system not just a game

Cadence is both a set of rules and a selection of game modules, expansions that use the core rules and provide setting, army lists, additional thematic rules, and more, to create a fully fledged game. That way it is possible to create a wide variety of new games without constantly having to re-invent basic mechanics. While all of these games share the core rules, the way they are implemented give each game it's own unique flavour and interest. So Cadence isn't just a game, it's a way to make games, and to make them any way you like.

### Community Owned

While Cadence has been initially developed by a single person, every aspect of the rules and modules are licensed under a Creative Commons by Attribution 4.0 License, you can find the project source on Github. This means the rules are free to use and alter for any purpose so long as attribution is given to the original project.

In addition, the project invites any interested party to contribute, helping to shape the future of the game.
