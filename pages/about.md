Cadence is a set of wargaming rules: describing how you would move and attack with models on the tabletop. However, it is how these rules are utilised to make unique games, and how these rules are developed and licensed, that makes Cadence what it is.

### Simple and Fun Core Rules

The core rules of Cadence are simple and quick to learn, with a dynamic flow of actions, and enough depth for experienced gamers. It is a D6 system with alternating activations that streamlines most of the traditional elements of tabletop wargames. This allows the core rules to be fun and light while game modules, expansions created for the system, can implement only those rules that provide thematic or tactical depth.

### Game Modules

Game Modules are how you play Cadence. Each module is it's own unique game, providing army lists to choose your models from, custom rules for that setting, missions, stories and almost anything else you might need.

There are several modules already created for you to try, some light and some more in-depth. Beyond that we encourage players and designers to get involved, to help us expand our modules, to balance and modify them, and to create new ones. And if you have a game you want to create you can even use the Cadence system thanks to it's permissive license.

### Attribution License

Every aspect of the rules and modules are licensed under a Creative Commons by Attribution 4.0 License, you can find details on this [on the projects GitHub page](https://github.com/open-source-tabletop/cadence). This license means the rules are free, anyone can duplicate them, modify them, use them for any purpose (even commercial) so long as attribution to the original project is given.

### Community Developed

One of the major goals of Cadence is to become a truly community owned project. While the initial project has been the work of a single person the project is looking for developers and players to drive the future of the game. Every aspect of community development is desired, from simple feedback on rules, promoting the game, creating a group to author new modules and future versions, and to manage any community spaces.
