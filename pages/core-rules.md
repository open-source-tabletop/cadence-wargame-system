## Basic Rules

### Dice

Cadence uses six-sided dice ("d6") to determine the outcome of actions. Most rolls are based on a single d6 which may have modifiers applied to them. To succeed, the dice must score equal to or above a target number. However, a roll of 1 always counts as a failure regardless of any modifiers.

You may also be asked to "roll-off" against other players, each player rolls 2 d6. The winner is the player with the highest combined result. In case of a tie, players roll-off again. Dice rolls should be done in full view of all players, and, when a rule permits you to re-roll a dice you may only re-roll a dice once.

### Distance and Measuring

Cadence uses inches for measuring movement and range, you'll need an inch-marked ruler to play. Always measure the distance to or from a model from the closest point on its base. You may measure any distance at any time, as long as it doesn't interfere with your opponent's actions or unnecessarily slow down the game. Remember that a model or object is considered "within" a certain distance if any part of it is closer than the specified distance.

### Armies

In Cadence, each player has a selection of miniatures that represent their army. This can vary depending on the module you choose but will usually include a range of units, such as infantry, vehicles, or monsters, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Every model in a player's army is considered friendly, all the models in your opponent's army are considered enemies.

### Units and Models

In the game, a "model" is a specific term referring to a miniature or group of miniatures mounted on a single base or otherwise connected. If a model does not have a base, it must have a clear footprint to count as a base. "Units" are groups of 1 or more models within the game. All models must belong to exactly one unit. Some games modules feature large units of models while smaller games will typically have 1 model in each unit.

#### Profiles

To play the game, you need to know which models you can use and what they can do on the battlefield. Each model in the game has a profile that lists its attributes, weapons, equipment, special abilities, and any unique rules it may have. The unit profiles are provided in each module, often grouped into different factions or army lists.

#### Attributes

Each model in Cadence has a set of attributes that tell you how well it can perform various actions, these are:

- Command (Cmd): The number of actions this model can perform each round.
- Movement (Mov): The number of inches this model can travel during a move action.
- Skill (Skl): The model's ability with it's weapons.
- Defence (Def): The model's armour or ability to negate attacks.
- Toughness (Tgh): The model's ability to counter damage and keep fighting.
- Hit Points (HP): How much damage the model can take before being destroyed.

#### Special Rules

Special rules modify how the model operates within the game. Some special rules are universal and are included in this book, these are typically given simply by name in a unit profile. Others are unique to a module, army, or model, and will be provided in the unit's profile or army list.

#### Abilities

Abilities are like actions that are unique to a unit. These work like normal actions and the details of how they work, the number of command points they require to perform, along with any requirements or restrictions, will be given in a unit's profile.

#### Unit Formation

Units consisting of more than one model must stay within close proximity of each other during a battle, known as being "in formation". A unit is in formation when the distance between each model forms a chain connecting all the models with a gap between each model no larger than 2 inches. Every time you activate a unit, after you move each of your models, the unit must finish that action in formation.

It is possible for your unit to become out of formation during another units activation, by losing models as they are destroyed for example. If this happens, the next time the unit activates it must make a move action as it's first action to restore being in formation. If it cannot resume being in formation after this move action the unit is destroyed and removed from the game.

#### Facing and Arcs

Each model in Cadence has a forward-facing direction, typically the direction the miniature is facing. If this is not clear, you should agree with your opponent or mark a point on the model's base. By extension, there is also an opposite backward-facing direction for the model.

Additionally, each model divides the battlefield around it into four 90-degree zones, called arcs. The front arc is centered on the model's forward-facing direction, the rear arc is aligned with the backward-facing direction, and the left and right arcs are to the model's left and right, respectively.

To determine which arc a model or unit is in, it is considered to be in the front-most possible arc. If a model or unit is partially in more than one arc, the front arc takes priority, followed by the left and right arcs, with the rear arc being the lowest priority.

### Weapons

The weapons that your models fight with also have their own set of attributes which are usually provided in your module or army list. These are:

- Range (Rng): The distance the weapon can make an attack up to.
- Attacks (Att): The volume or intensity of the attacks from the weapon.
- Damage (Dmg): How destructive a hit from this weapon is.
- Piercing (Prc): The weapons ability to negate armour.
- Special Rules that apply to the weapon.

### Missions

When you play a game of Cadence, you will select a mission to play. A mission is a set of rules that dictates how to set up the battlefield, how armies are deployed, and what objectives players must achieve to win. Simply put, playing a game means playing a mission.

There are three simple missions included in the Advanced Rules section of this book, with more available in modules. Additionally, players are encouraged to create their own missions.

Victory Points are awarded to players throughout the game based on the mission objectives. The player with the most Victory Points at the end of the game is declared the winner.

#### Objective Markers

Objectives Markers represent key points on the battlefield, such as resources to be collected, intel to be gathered, or zones to be controlled. An objective marker is typically a 40mm token or miniature. Objectives come in 3 basic types, each of which can first be secured, or controlled by a unit, and then scored when they award points according to a mission. Additional types may be specified by a game module.

To secure an Objective Marker, a unit must use the "Secure" action when it is within 1 inch of the marker and no enemy units are within 3 inches of it. The unit must make a successful Secure Roll, rolling a d6 and scoring 3 or higher to secure an objective.

Objectives can be one of the following 3 types:

- Control: Once a control objective is secured, it remains secured so long as at least 1 unit from the securing army stays within 3 inches of the objective.
- Access: Once this objective is secured the unit that secured it must stay within 1 inch until the end of the current round, after which it is removed from the game and scored. Access objectives cannot be secured on the first round.
- Recover: Once this objective is secured the unit that secured it must survive until the end of the battle to score any victory points from it. If the unit that secured the objective is destroyed the objective is destroyed.

#### Entry Points

At the start of the game, all of your units begin off the table and are considered "in reserve." To deploy your units onto the table, you set up a number of Entry Points markers according to your mission. During the first round your models will activate from reserve and make their way onto the battlefield from these Entry Points, typically located along a table edge.

#### Mission Parameters

Each mission includes some parameters, detailing some or all of the following information:

- Any rules for setting up the terrain on your table.
- The number and type of objectives to be placed on your table.
- The conditions under which players will score Victory Points.
- The placement of Entry Points, used for deploying your units onto the battlefield.

## Playing the Game

### Structure of a Game

Cadence is broken down into easy to follow stages and steps, these are as follows:

#### Stage 1: Setup

Stage 1 is a few simple steps to set up your battlefield ready to play.

1. Choose a Mission
2. Set Up Terrain
3. Set Up Markers
4. Put Armies into Reserve

#### Stage 2: Battle

Stage 2 is played in a series of rounds with the following steps each round:

1. Roll For Initiative
2. Place Command Dice
3. Players Alternate Activations
4. Score Victory Points

### Setup

#### Choosing A Mission

Choose a mission that outlines the setup of your board, game length, victory conditions, and other relevant information. You can use one of the 3 basic missions provided or create your own. More missions may be available from game modules.

#### Set Up Terrain

Set up your terrain according to your chosen mission or as you see fit. Include a mix of large line-of-sight blocking elements and smaller scatter pieces. If one player sets up all the terrain, the other player should have an opportunity to modify it.

#### Set Up Markers

Set up any Objective Markers and Entry Points according to your Mission Parameters.

#### Put Armies into Reserve

Place all units to be used in the game near the table so that both players can see which units each player is using, and which units are already deployed as the game progresses.

### Battle

#### Rounds

The battle stage of a game of Cadence is played over a set number of rounds, typically four. During each round, players take turns activating their units to move and fight.

#### Roll for Initiative

At the start of each new round, players roll-off to determine who has the initiative for that round. The player who rolls the highest has the initiative and gets the first activation.

#### Place Command Dice

At the start of each round you place a six sided dice next to each of your units, including those in reserve, showing their available Command Points for the round. This is always the highest Command attribute of the models in the unit.

#### Alternate Activations

Once both players have placed all of their Command Dice, they can take turns activating one of their units, starting with the player who won the initiative. Players select a unit that still has Command Points and spend those points to perform a number of actions from a selection listed below. After performing all desired actions play moves onto the next player to repeat this process.

This continues until both players have used all of the Command Points on all of their units. If one player has no units left to activate, play returns to the other player until both players have finished.

#### Deploying From Reserve

As your units do not begin on the battlefield, they must be deployed from reserve. When it is your turn to activate a unit, you may choose a unit already on the battlefield or one in reserve. If you choose a unit in reserve, it is placed up to its Movement attribute in inches from one of your Entry Points and then activates as normal. This does not count as having taken a Move action and can be done before declaring your actions for that unit.

Unless another rule permits it, each player must deploy all of their units on the battlefield during the first turn. If a unit cannot be placed within range of an entry point, then it cannot be deployed. If it must be deployed but cannot be placed, it is destroyed.

## Actions

When you activate a unit, you first declare the actions you are going to perform and the order in which you will perform them. You then pay the appropriate cost from the unit's Command Points, but you do not have to spend all of them in one activation. Keep in mind the following restrictions:

- You must spend at least 2 Command Points per activation, unless your unit has only 1 Command Point remaining.
- You may spend a maximum of 4 Command Points per activation.
- You may only perform each action once per activation.
- If you begin your activation with only 1 Command Point remaining, roll a d6. On a roll of 1, this last Command Point is lost, and this still counts as your activation.

### Action: Move

During a Move action, each model in a unit can move up to its Movement attribute in inches, as long as the unit finishes in formation. Always measure from the same point on the base to avoid moving any part of the model beyond the allowed distance. Models move in a straight line along their forward facing, but may pivot on the spot as needed.

Models cannot move over the base of any enemy models, but can move over friendly models' bases as long as they don't overlap when they finish moving. Models should not move outside of the game board, any that do so are immediately destroyed.

#### Terrain

During the movement phase, models may encounter various types of terrain, which may impede their movement. There are different types of terrain, each with specific rules that can affect the movement of models. For more information on terrain rules, please refer to the Advanced Rules section.

### Action: Advance

An Advance action follows the same rules as a Move action but must be taken immediately after a Move action.

### Action: Attack

When your unit takes an attack action, you declare which models in your unit will target which enemy units and which weapons you will use. Each model can use only one weapon. You may choose different targets for each model in your unit. If there are any enemy units within 1 inch of your unit, you must choose one of them as your target.

Before rolling any dice, you need to determine if you have line of sight to your target and if it is in range. You may change which models are targeting which units while checking this, but once you start rolling dice, you can no longer change your targets.

#### Line of Sight

To determine line of sight, you check if any model in your unit that is targeting the unit can see models in the enemy unit. You can ignore intervening models in both the attacking and target units. Check this by looking through the model at tabletop level.

- If you can see at least one model in the target unit without any obstruction, you have a **clear** line of sight.
- If you can see at least one model in the target unit, but none without obstruction, you have an **obstructed** line of sight.
- If any models in the enemy unit are partially obscured by another unit, or you cannot see any models in the enemy unit, you have a **blocked** line of sight.
- If you are attacking a unit within 1 inch and can see any models in the unit then it always counts as a **clear** line of sight.

#### Check Range

For every model in your attacking unit you need to check that it is in range to their chosen target. Measure the distance between that model and the nearest model in the target unit. If it is equal to or less than the weapon's range attribute the model is in range and may perform an attack.

#### Attack Procedure

Once you have determined your targets and line of sights you follow the attack procedure outlined below. You can follow this procedure for each model in your unit or you can combine attacks from each model with the same Skill value using the same weapon to speed up the process. Repeat the process until you have made all of your attacks.

#### Step 1 - Attack Rolls

Make Attack Rolls equal to the attacks attribute of the weapon being used. Each roll is a d6 trying to equal or beat the attacking model's Skill attribute. When multiple models attack with the same weapon against the same unit, roll the combined number of these attacks together. Every successful roll is a hit.

- **Close Range Penalty**: Attack Rolls against a target unit within 1 inch of your unit only hit on a roll of a 6, instead of using the attacking model's Skill attribute. However, weapons with the Assault special rule don't suffer this penalty.
- **Rush Penalty**: Models using 3 or more Command Points this activation suffer a -2 penalty to their Attack Rolls.
- **Height Advantage**: Gain a +1 to your Attack Roll when attacking a target at a lower height level.
- **Obscured Penalty**: When attacking a target with an obscured line of sight, suffer a -1 penalty to your Attack Roll.

#### Step 2 - Defence Rolls

For every successful hit against a target unit, the target player makes a Defence Roll. Roll a d6 trying to score equal or higher than that unit's Defence attribute. This roll is reduced by the attacking weapon's Piercing attribute, and may be modified to the point where it will automatically fail. Each failed Defence Roll results in the target taking 1 point of damage.

#### Step 3 - Counter Rolls

For each point of damage a unit takes, it must test to see if it can counter the damage, or if it will lose a Hit Point. Roll a d6, to counter the damage you must equal or beat a specific target based on the rules below:

- If the Damage attribute of the weapon is **half, or lower, of the targets Toughness** you counter the damage on a roll of 2+.
- If the Damage attribute of the weapon is **less than the targets Toughness** you counter the damage on a roll of 3+.
- If the Damage attribute of the weapon is **equal to the targets Toughness** you counter the damage on a roll of 4+.
- If the Damage attribute of the weapon is **more than the targets Toughness** you counter the damage on a roll of 5+.
- If the Damage attribute of the weapon is **double, or more than double, the targets Toughness** you counter the damage on a roll of 6+.

#### Step 4 - Reduce Hit Points

The target player assigns all lost hit points to one model in the target unit, starting with any model that has already lost hit points. If that model is reduced to 0 hit points, remove it from the game as destroyed and select another model. Continue doing this until you have assigned all the damage to models, or until every model in the unit has been removed. If a model loses hit points but isn't reduced to 0, it can be useful to place a die or marker next to the model, indicating the remaining hit points.

### Action: Ability

An ability is a unique action that some units possess. The details of any ability will be listed in the unit's profile, army list, or module.

### Action: Secure

To secure an objective, a unit must take a Secure action while being within 1 inch of the objective marker, with no enemy units within 3 inches of the objective marker. The unit attempting to secure the objective must make a successful Secure Roll by rolling a d6 and scoring 3 or higher.

### Action: Pass

This action does nothing but permits a unit to wait during its turn without making another action.

## Advanced Rules

### Terrain

A model cannot move through terrain objects and instead must move around them or over them following the rules for different kinds of terrain. To understand how your terrain works the game uses a simple system of keywords. A keyword may apply to a whole piece of terrain or to specific parts of your terrain. Make sure all players know which keywords apply to the terrain before playing. The following keywords can be applied to different parts of your terrain to define how they work in the game:

#### Keyword: Clear

This keyword applies to any area on your terrain on which models can be placed and move as normal, this is usually for walkways, the tops of hills and so on. Terrain is only clear if the model can be securely placed on it, if a model has a base that is too large or is otherwise restricted then the terrain is considered impassable.

#### Keyword: Climbable

Climbable usually refers to an area of vertical terrain that connects two different height levels or that can be climbed over. Models can move up climbable terrain at the cost of 1 inch of their allowed movement for each level ascended. Models may climb down climbable terrain at the cost of 1 inch of their allowed movement for every 2 full levels descended (so climbing down 1 level is free). Models may only climb up or down if they have sufficient movement to complete their movement on clear terrain or on an unobstructed area of the battlefield.

#### Keyword: Impassable

Models cannot climb over or move through this piece of terrain.

#### Keyword: Rough

Terrain with the rough keyword may be moved across at the cost of 1 inch of allowed movement, in addition to the distance travelled, however models may not finish their movement on rough terrain.

#### Keyword: Cover

Units that are targeted for an attack that gain an obscured line of sight through this terrain gain a +2 to their Defence Rolls.

#### Height Levels

When you have terrain that has different height levels, you should assign each clear area a height level, typically a battlefield will have only 1 or 2 height levels. The lowest level is always considered height 0 and each height level counting up is typically around 1-2 inches difference. Models may only ascend height levels where there is climbable terrain that connects the two height levels.

If you have terrain that is different levels but not any significant change then it should be the same height level as the nearest area, allowing models to freely move across small changes.

### Universal Special Rules

Special rules are a set of modifiers to how models operate within the game. The rules presented here are universal and will usually only be included in a unit profile by name. Some special rules have a value indicated in their title, such as Heavy Armour (X), where X can be different values for each unit. When a unit has this rule it will be given with a value in place of the X, substitute this value in the text of the special rule.

#### Unit Special Rules

| Rule | Details |
| ---- | ------- |
| Flying | Models with this rule are not affected by intervening terrain or models when they move, so long as they finish their move in an allowed position. These models ignore any penalties for changing height levels. |
| Heavy Armour (X) | Reduce the piercing value of attacks made against this unit it by X to a minimum of 0. |
| Non-Scoring | This unit cannot secure objectives. |
| Resilient | This model may re-roll any failed defence rolls that roll a 1. |
| Rugged | This model ignores the penalty for travelling through rough terrain. |
| Shields | While this model has it's full Hit Points it may re-roll failed attempts to Counter Damage. |
| Skilled | This unit may re-roll any attack rolls that roll a 1. |
| Stealth (X) | Attacks against this model from more than X inches away suffer -1 to their Attack Rolls. |
| Support | Models with this rule do not need to be deployed on the first turn and may instead be held in reserve in subsequent turns. These models must be deployed in the second or third turn. |

#### Weapon Special Rules

| Rules | Details |
| ----- | ------- |
| Accurate | When making an attack with this weapon your attack roll has a +1 modifier. |
| Arc (X) | This weapon may only be used against models in the named arcs. |
| Assault | This weapon does not suffer from the Close Range Penalty when making attacks. |
| Fixed | This weapon can only target enemy models that are directly on the line of this models forward facing measured from the centre of the base. |
| Heavy | A unit must spend an additional Command Point to use this weapon. |
| Inaccurate | When making an attack with this weapon your attack roll only hits on an Attack roll of a 6. |
| Indirect | Attacks with this weapon count an obscured line of sight as clear. |
| One Use | This weapon may only be used once per battle. |
| Rapid Fire (X) | This weapon gains +X to it's Attack attribute against targets within half of it's maximum range. |
| Rending (X) | When an attack with this weapon hits with a roll of 6, it counts as doing X additional hits. |
| Shred | Rolls to Counter Damage have a -1 modifier against weapons with this rule. |
| Torrent | An attack with this weapon hits on any attack roll that is not a 1. |
| Volley | Each attack roll that rolls a 6 allows the attacker to roll and additional attack roll, these additional rolls do not generate additional rolls. |
