## Basic Rules

### Dice

Cadence uses six-sided dice (**d6**) to determine the outcome of actions. Most rolls are based on a single d6 which may have modifiers applied to them. The roll succeeds if the number rolled is equal to or above the target number (usually written as the target number and a plus sign i.e. 3+), otherwise it is a failure. A dice roll can be negatively modified so that success isn't possible, though **a roll of 1 always counts as a failure** regardless of any positive modifiers.

You may also be asked to **roll-off** against other players, each player rolls 2d6 - the winner is the player with the highest combined result. In a tie, players roll-off again. Dice rolls should always be done in full view of all players, and, when a rule permits you to re-roll a dice **you may only ever re-roll a dice once** and you must accept the result of the re-rolled dice even if it is worse.

### Distance and Measuring

Cadence uses inches for measuring movement and range, you'll need an inch-marked ruler to play. Always measure the distance to or from a model from the closest point on its base. You may measure any distance at any time, as long as it doesn't interfere with your opponent's actions or unnecessarily slow down the game. Remember that a model or object is considered "within" a certain distance if any part of it's base is closer than the specified distance and a unit is within a distance so long as 1 model from that unit is.

### Armies

In Cadence, each player has a selection of miniatures that represent their army. This can vary depending on the module you choose but will usually include a range of units, such as infantry, vehicles, or monsters, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Every model in a player's army is considered **friendly**, all the models in your opponent's army are considered an **enemy**.

### Units and Models

In the game, a **model** is a specific term referring to a miniature or group of miniatures mounted on a single base or otherwise connected. If a model does not have a base, it must have a clear footprint to count as a base. **Units** are groups of 1 or more models within the game. All models must belong to exactly one unit. Some games feature large units of models while smaller games will typically have 1 model in each unit.

#### Army Lists and Profiles

To play the game, you need to know which models you can use and what they can do on the battlefield. Each model in the game has a profile that lists its attributes, weapons, equipment, special abilities, and any unique rules it may have. The unit profiles are provided in each module, often grouped into different factions in army lists.

#### Attributes

Each model in Cadence has a set of attributes that tell you how well it can perform various actions, these are:

- **Command (Cmd)**: The number of actions this model can perform each round.
- **Movement (Mov)**: The number of inches this model can travel during a move or advance action:
- **Skill (Skl)**: The model's ability with it's weapons.
- **Defence (Def)**: The model's armour or ability to evade attacks.
- **Toughness (Tgh)**: The model's ability to counter or absorb damage and keep fighting.
- **Hit Points (HP)**: How much damage the model can take before being destroyed.

#### Special Rules

Special rules modify how the model operates within the game. Some special rules are universal and are included in this book, these are typically given simply by name in a unit profile. Others are unique to a module, army, or model, and will be provided in the unit's profile or army list.

#### Abilities

Abilities are like actions that are unique to a unit. These work like normal actions and the details of how they work, the number of command points they require to perform, along with any requirements or restrictions, will be given in a unit's profile.

#### Unit Formation

Units consisting of more than one model must stay within close proximity of each other during a battle, known as being **in formation**. A unit is in formation when each model is **within 6 inches of every other model** in the unit, if the unit contains 10 or more models this distance is **increased to 8** inches. Every unit must finish each action they perform in formation.

It is possible for your unit to become out of formation during another unit's activation, by losing models as they are destroyed for example. If this happens, the next time the unit activates it must make a move action as it's first action to restore being in formation. If it cannot resume being in formation after this move action the unit is destroyed and removed from the game.

### Weapons

The weapons that your models fight with also have their own set of attributes which are usually provided in your module or army list. These are:

- **Range (Rng)**: The distance the weapon can make an attack up to.
- **Attacks (Att)**: The volume or intensity of the attacks from the weapon.
- **Piercing (Prc)**: The weapons ability to negate armour.
- **Damage (Dmg)**: How destructive a hit from this weapon is.
- **Special Rules** that apply to the weapon.

### Missions

When you play a game of Cadence you always select a mission to play. A mission is a set of rules that dictates how to set up the battlefield and what objectives players must achieve to win. **Victory Points** are awarded to players throughout the game based on the mission objectives. The player with the most Victory Points at the end of the game is declared the winner.

#### Objective Markers

Objectives Markers represent key points on the battlefield, such as resources to be collected, intel to be gathered, or zones to be controlled. An objective marker is typically a **40mm token** or appropriate miniature. Objectives come in 3 basic types, each of which can **first be secured**, or controlled by a unit, and then **scored when they award points** according to a mission. Additional types may be specified by a game module.

To secure an Objective Marker, a unit must use the "Secure" action when it is within **1 inch of the marker** and no enemy units are within 3 inches of it or the securing unit. The unit must make a successful Secure Roll, rolling a d6 and scoring **3 or higher** to secure an objective.

Objectives can be one of the following 3 types:

- **Control**: Once a control objective is secured, it remains secured so long as at least 1 unit from the securing army stays within 3 inches of the objective.
- **Access**: Once this objective is secured the unit that secured it must stay within 1 inch until the end of the current round, after which it is removed from the game and scored. _Access objectives cannot be secured on the first round._
- **Recover**: Once this objective is secured the unit that secured it must survive until the end of the battle to score it. If the unit that secured the objective is destroyed the objective is destroyed.

#### Entry Points

At the start of the game, all of your units begin off the table and are considered **in reserve**. To deploy your units onto the table, you set up a number of **Entry Points** markers according to your mission. During the first round your models will activate from reserve and make their way onto the battlefield from these Entry Points, typically located along a table edge.

#### Mission Parameters

Each mission includes some parameters, detailing some or all of the following information:

- Any rules for setting up the terrain on your table.
- The number and type of objectives to be placed on your table.
- The conditions under which players will score Victory Points.
- The placement of Entry Points, used for deploying your units onto the battlefield.





## Playing the Game

### Structure of a Game

The gameplay of Cadence is divided into easy to follow stages and steps, these are as follows:

### Stage 1: Setup

#### Step 1: Choosing A Mission

To begin - choose a mission that outlines the setup of your board, game length, victory conditions, and other relevant information from your game module.

#### Step 2: Set Up Terrain

Set up your terrain - your chosen mission may indicate required elements. Include a mix of large line-of-sight blocking elements and smaller scatter pieces. If one player sets up all the terrain, the other player should have an opportunity to modify it.

#### Step 3: Set Up Markers

Set up any Objective Markers and Entry Points according to your Mission parameters.

#### Step 4: Put Armies into Reserve

Place all units to be used in the game near the table so that both players can see which units each player is using, and which units are already deployed as the game progresses.

### Stage 2: Battle

#### Rounds

The battle stage of a game is played over a set number of rounds, typically 5 but each game module may specify a different number. During each round, players take alternating turns activating their units to move and fight.

#### Roll for Initiative

At the start of each new round, players roll-off to determine who has the initiative for that round. The player who rolls the highest has the initiative and gets the first activation.

#### Place Command Dice

At the start of each round you place a six sided dice next to each of your units, including those in reserve, showing their available Command Points for the round. This is always the highest Command attribute of the models in the unit.

#### Alternate Activations

Once both players have placed all of their Command Dice, they can take turns activating one of their units, starting with the player who won the initiative. Players select a unit that still has Command Points and spend those points to perform a number of actions from a selection listed below. After performing all desired actions play moves onto the next player to repeat this process.

This continues until both players have used all of the Command Points on all of their units. If one player has no units left to activate, play returns to the other player until both players have finished.

#### Deploying From Reserve

As your units do not begin on the battlefield, they must be **deployed from reserve**. When it is your turn to activate a unit, you may choose a unit already on the battlefield or one in reserve. If you choose a unit in reserve, each model is placed **within its Movement attribute in inches** from one of your Entry Points and in formation, and then activates as normal. This does not count as having taken a Move action and can be done before declaring your actions for that unit.

Unless another rule permits it, each player must deploy all of their units on the battlefield during the first turn. If a unit cannot be placed within range of an entry point, then it cannot be deployed. If it must be deployed but cannot be placed, it is destroyed.





## Actions

When you activate a unit, you first **declare the actions you are going to perform** and the order in which you will perform them. You then pay the appropriate cost from the unit's Command Points and reduce the Command Dice by that cost. You do not have to spend all of your Command Points in one activation. For units with multiple models you perform the action for every model before moving onto the next action. Keep in mind the following restrictions:

- You must spend **at least 2 Command Points** per activation, unless your unit has only 1 Command Point remaining.
- You may spend a **maximum of 4 Command Points** per activation.
- You may only perform **each action once** per activation.
- If you begin your activation with only 1 Command Point remaining, roll a d6. **On a roll of 1, this last Command Point is lost**, the unit takes no action however this still counts as your activation.

**Note**: You may declare an action that will only be possible depending on the outcome of the previous action - if you do so and the action is still not possible after the previous actions then it is treated as a pass action instead.


### Action: Move

During a Move action, each model in a unit can move up to its Movement attribute in inches, as long as the unit finishes in formation. Always measure from the same point on a model's base and move the model in straight line sections to avoid moving more than the allowed distance.

A model's base may **never move over the base of any enemy models**, but are permitted to move over the bases of friendly models - so long as they do not overlap at the end of their movement. Models are not permitted to move any part of their base outside of the battlefield.

#### Terrain

During a move action, models may encounter various types of terrain, which may impede their movement. There are different types of terrain, each with specific rules - more information on different kinds of terrain is found in the Advanced Rules section.

### Action: Advance

An Advance action follows the same rules as a Move action but may only be taken immediately after a Move action.

### Action: Attack

When you take an attack action each model will be able to choose one of their weapons and target one enemy model that they can see. They then follow the attack procedure below to determine the outcome of the attack. When choosing a target, if there are any enemy models within 3 inches of your model you must choose one of those as your target.

#### Step 1 - Determine Line of Sight and Range

When you choose your target model you must check how well you can see that model and if it is in range before making your attack. Firstly, for line of sight, this is done "through the eyes of the model" - meaning you might need to look through the model at tabletop level.

- If you can see the model without any part being covered, you have a **clear** line of sight.
- If you can see the model but it is partly covered, you have an **obstructed** line of sight.
- If the model is partially obscured by another model, or you cannot see it at all, you have a **blocked** line of sight.
- If the model is within 1 inch of a friendly model, and you are more than 1 inch away, you have a **blocked** line of sight.
- If you are attacking a model within 1 inch and can see any part of it then it always counts as a **clear** line of sight.

Your chosen target model must be within range for an attack, this distance is the attacking weapon's **Range** attribute in inches.

#### Step 2 - Attack Rolls

Make **Attack Rolls** equal to the **attacks** attribute of the weapon being used. Each roll is a d6 trying to equal or beat the attacking model's **Skill attribute**. Every successful roll is a **hit**. The following modifiers apply:

- **Close Range Penalty**: Attack Rolls against a target unit within 1 inch of your model only hit on a **roll of a 6**, instead of using the attacking model's Skill attribute. However, weapons with the **Assault** special rule don't suffer this penalty.
- **Rush Penalty**: Units performing 3 or more actions this activation suffer a **-2 modifier** to their Attack Rolls.
- **Height Advantage**: Gain a **+1 modifier** to your Attack Roll when attacking a model at a lower height level (see the terrain rules).
- **Obscured Penalty**: When attacking a target with an obscured line of sight, suffer a **-1 modifier** to your Attack Roll.

#### Step 3 - Defence Rolls

For every successful hit against a target model, the target player makes a **Defence Roll**. Roll a d6 trying to score equal or higher than that model's **Defence attribute**. This roll is reduced by the attacking weapon's **Piercing attribute**, and may be modified to the point where it will automatically fail. Each failed Defence Roll results in the model taking 1 point of **damage**.

#### Step 4 - Counter Rolls

For each point of damage a model takes, it must test to see if it can **Counter** the damage, or if it will lose a **Hit Point**. If the model's Hit Points are reduced to 0 it is removed from the game as destroyed, otherwise place a red dice or other marker next to the model indicating how many Hit Points it has remaining. The counter roll uses the targets **Toughness**. Roll a d6, to counter the damage you must equal or beat a specific target based on the rules below:

| Weapon Damage vs target Toughness            | Counter Roll |
| :------------------------------------------- | :----------: |
| Damage is half, or lower, than Toughness     | 2+           |
| Damage is lower than Toughness               | 3+           |
| Damage is equal to Toughness                 | 4+           |
| Damage is higher than Toughness              | 5+           |
| Damage is double, or higher, than Toughness  | 6+           |

### Action: Ability

An ability is a unique action that some units possess. The details of any ability will be listed in the unit's profile, army list, or module.

### Action: Secure

To secure an objective a unit must be within 1 inch of the objective marker, with no enemy units within 3 inches of the objective marker or the securing unit. The unit attempting to secure the objective must make a successful Secure Roll by rolling a d6 and **scoring 3 or higher**.

### Action: Pass

The pass action is used when you either do not wish to do anything with your unit or have no other options available. The unit does nothing during this action. You may use this action multiple times.





## Advanced Rules

### Terrain

A model cannot always move through terrain objects and instead must move around, over, or through them. To define how your terrain works each piece, or sometimes just a specific part of your terrain, can be assigned a **keyword**--. Make sure all players know which keywords apply to the terrain before playing. The following keywords can be applied to different parts of your terrain to define how they work in the game:

#### Keyword: Clear

This keyword applies to any area on your terrain on which models can be placed and move as normal, this is usually for walkways, the tops of hills and so on. Terrain is only clear if the model can be securely placed on it, if a model has a base that is too large or is otherwise restricted then the terrain is considered impassable.

#### Keyword: Climbable

Climbable usually refers to an area of vertical terrain that connects two different height levels or that can be climbed over. Models can move up climbable terrain at the cost of 1 inch of their allowed movement for each level ascended. Models may climb down climbable terrain at the cost of 1 inch of their allowed movement for every 2 full levels descended (so climbing down 1 level is free). Models may only climb up or down if they have sufficient movement to complete their movement on clear terrain or on an unobstructed area of the battlefield.

#### Keyword: Impassable

Models cannot climb over or move through this piece of terrain.

#### Keyword: Rough

Terrain with the rough keyword may be moved across at the cost of 1 inch of allowed movement, in addition to the distance travelled, however models may not finish their movement on rough terrain.

#### Keyword: Cover

Models that are targeted for an attack that gain an obscured line of sight through this terrain gain a +2 to their Defence Rolls.

#### Height Levels

When you have terrain that has different height levels, you should assign each clear area a height level, typically a battlefield will have only 1 or 2 height levels. The lowest level is always considered height 0 and each height level counting up is typically around 1-2 inches difference. Models may only ascend height levels where there is climbable terrain that connects the two height levels.

If you have terrain that is different levels but not any significant change then it should be the same height level as the nearest area, allowing models to freely move across small changes.

### Facing and Arcs

While not used by all game modules, sometimes it is important to know which direction a model is facing and where other models are in relation to it. Each model has a forward-facing direction, typically the direction the miniature is facing. If this is not clear, you should agree with your opponent or mark a point on the model's base. There is also an opposite backward-facing direction for the model.

Each model divides the battlefield around it into four 90-degree zones, called arcs, centred on the centre of the models base. The front arc is aligned to the model's forward-facing direction, the rear arc is aligned with the backward-facing direction, and the left and right side arcs are to the model's left and right, respectively.

To determine which arc an enemy model is in, it is considered to be in the front-most possible arc. If a model is partially in more than one arc then the front arc takes priority, followed by the side arcs, with the rear arc being the lowest priority.

### Vehicles and Transports 

Vehicles are a special type of model typically characterised by their increased size, limited flexibility when moving, and inability to interact with some kinds of terrain. These limitations are often balanced with increased firepower and armour. Transports are a type of vehicle which can be used to move other models around the battlefield.  The following rules represent a simple way to include vehicles in a game module which can be used as presented, expanded upon, or replaced with custom rules.

Models with the **Vehicle** or **Transport** special rules have the following changes to their rules:

#### Vehicle Movement

When a vehicle moves it must always move directly forward or backward and may not freely pivot during this movement. During either a Move or Advance action the model may make up to 2 pivots of up to 45 degrees - these must be separated by moving at least 1 inch.

Vehicles may not move over the base of any other model and other friendly models may not move over a vehicle's base.

#### Vehicles and Terrain

Vehicles ignore the **Climbable** keyword for terrain, treating them as impassable instead. Vehicles do not get the benefit from terrain with the **Cover** keyword.

#### Vehicles and Attacks

Vehicles ignore the **Heavy** keyword when making attacks. In addition line of sight should be worked out from the barrel of the weapon being used and can be obscured by the models own parts. When being attacked, models count an **obscured** line of sight to a vehicle as **clear**. Unless otherwise stated, a vehicle has the **Platform (2)** and **Weak Spot (Rear)** special rules.

#### Transports

Transports are a special type of vehicle model which can carry other models across the battlefield. Transports have the special rule **Transport (X)** which indicates the number of models that it can carry. These models may not be other **Vehicle** or **Transport** models and models with the **Large** special rule count as 2 models.

#### Embarking and Disembarking

A unit that wishes to travel in a friendly Transport must be within 1 inch of the Transport model, if the Transport has sufficient capacity to carry all models in the unit the unit may **Embark**, the unit is removed from the battlefield and placed back into reserve, if you have multiple units in transports you must make a note of which units are in which transports.

A unit that is embarked on a transport may be activated from reserve if it has Command Points remaining to **Disembark**. A unit treats the Transport model as it's Entry Point, being placed up to it's Movement attribute in inches from the Transport, but may not make a Move or Advance action in the same activation as they disembarked. If a unit disembarks and cannot place all models from the unit then any models not placed are destroyed.

#### Destroying a Transport

If a Transport model is destroyed while one or more units are embarked, these units are immediately placed as close to where the Transport model was before being destroyed and are reduced to 0 Command Points. Any models that cannot be placed in formation are destroyed.

### Universal Special Rules

Special rules are a set of modifiers to how models operate within the game. The rules presented here are universal and will usually only be included in a unit profile by name. Some special rules have a value indicated in their title, such as Heavy Armour (X), where X can be different values for each unit. When a unit has this rule it will be given with a value in place of the X, substitute this value in the text of the special rule.

#### Unit Special Rules

| Rule | Details |
| ---- | ------- |
| Agile | This vehicle may make an additional 45 degree pivot during either their Move or Advance action. |
| Flying | Models with this rule are not affected by intervening terrain or models when they move, so long as they finish their move in an allowed position. These models ignore any penalties for changing height levels. |
| Heavy Armour (X) | Reduce the piercing value of attacks made against this model by X to a minimum of 0. |
| Large | This model counts as 2 models for calculating how many models a Transport can carry. |
| Non-Scoring | This unit cannot perform the Secure action. |
| Platform (X) | When taking an attack action this model may make attacks with X weapons it is equipped with instead of 1. |
| Resilient | This model may re-roll any failed Defence Rolls. |
| Rugged | This model ignores the penalty for travelling through rough terrain. |
| Shields | While this model has it's full Hit Points it may re-roll failed attempts to Counter Damage. |
| Skilled | This model may re-roll any failed Attack Rolls. |
| Steady | This model ignores the Heavy special rule. |
| Stealth (X) | Attacks against this model from more than X inches away count a **clear** line of sight as **obstructed** and an **obstructed** line of sight as **blocked**. |
| Support | Models with this rule do not need to be deployed on the first turn and may instead be held in reserve in subsequent turns. These models must be deployed in the second or third turn. |
| Transport (X) | This model counts as a Transport with a capacity of X, see the section **Vehicles and Transports** in the Advanced Rules. |
| Weak Spot (X) | Against attacks which originate in the named arc X, this model has -1 to its Defence and Counter Rolls. |
| Vehicle | This model counts as a Vehicle, see the section **Vehicles and Transports** in the Advanced Rules. |

#### Weapon Special Rules

| Rules | Details |
| ----- | ------- |
| Accurate | When making an attack with this weapon your attack roll has a +1 modifier. |
| Arc (X) | Attacks with this weapon can only target models in the named arc (X). |
| Assault | This weapon does not suffer from the Close Range Penalty when making attacks. |
| Blast (X) | If this weapon has at least one successful hit then it also counts as doing X hits to every other model, enemy or friendly, within 2 inches of the center of the original targets base. |
| Destructive (X) | Each failed Defence Roll against this weapon causes X damage instead of 1. |
| Fixed | Attacks with this weapon can only target models that lie directly in the path of this model's forward facing. |
| Grenade | Only 1 model in a unit may use a weapon with this rule per Attack Action. This weapon may not target a model closer than 3 inches. |
| Heavy | A unit must spend an additional Command Point to use this weapon. |
| Inaccurate | When making an attack with this weapon your Skill counts as 6+. |
| Indirect | Attacks with this weapon count an **obscured** line of sight as **clear**. This supercedes the Stealth special rule. |
| One Use | This weapon may only be used once per battle. |
| Rapid Fire (X) | This weapon may make X additional attacks at no additional Command Point cost. After each attack you may choose the same model as the target for the next attack or another model within 1 inch of the original. |
| Rending (X) | When an attack with this weapon hits with a roll of 6, it counts as doing X additional hits. |
| Shred | Rolls to Counter Damage have a -1 modifier against weapons with this rule. |
| Torrent | An attack with this weapon hits on any attack roll that is not a 1. |
| Volatile | Any attack roll that rolls a 1 counts as hitting the model that made the attack. |
| Volley | Each attack roll that rolls a 6 allows the attacker to roll an additional attack roll, these additional rolls do not generate additional rolls. |
