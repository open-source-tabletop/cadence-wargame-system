### Basic Rules

**Dice and Measuring**: Six sided dice are used for most actions, rolling equal to or above the target to succeed. A roll of 1 is always a failure. Modifiers add or subtract a number to the number rolled. You may only re-roll a dice once. Distances are measured in inches for movement and attack range, measuring from the closest points on a models base. You may measure anything at any time.

**Units and Models**: Every model in a players army is also part of just one unit. A unit is a collection of one or more models. A unit must stay "in formation", the distance between each model forming a chain connecting all the models with a gap between each model no larger than 2 inches. Every time you activate a unit, after you move each of your models, the unit must finish that action in formation or it is destroyed and removed from the game.

A model has the following attributes: 

- **Cmd** - Command: The number of actions this model can perform each round.
- **Mov** - Movement: The number of inches this model can travel during a move action:
- **Skl** - Skill: The model’s ability with it’s weapons.
- **Def** - Defence: The model’s armour or ability to negate attacks.
- **Tgh** - Toughness: How much damage the model can take for each of it’s hit points.
- **HP** - Hit Points: How much damage the model can take before being destroyed.

**Facing and Arcs**: Models divide the space around them into four 90 degree arcs, facing forward, backward, and to either side. A model also has a forward and backward facing based on these arcs. This should be marked on the model where it is not obvious. To determine which arc a model or unit is in, it is considered to be in the front-most possible arc, the front arc takes priority, followed by the left and right arcs, with the rear arc being the lowest priority.
