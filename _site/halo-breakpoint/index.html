                    <p>Halo: Breakpoint is a fan made game module set in the Halo universe that allows you to enact battles from any era in the Halo timeline using 28mm miniatures. As there are no official miniatures in this scale you will need to find suitable proxies, or fan made sculpts to use.</p>

<p>You will need the <a href="https://Cadence.Games/core-rules/">Cadence Core Rules</a> to play this game. If you would like to contribute to the development of Halo: Breakpoint please <a href="https://github.com/open-source-tabletop/halo-breakpoint">visit the Halo: Breakpoint Github Project</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In the 26th century, humankind has colonized hundreds of worlds in Earth’s interstellar neighborhood, only to stumble upon a hostile alliance of aliens known as the Covenant. Motivated by the Prophets’ promises of ascension to godhood in the form of the eponymous Halos, a series of ring-shaped superweapons built by the ancient race of the Forerunners, the Covenant are bent on humanity’s destruction. With the apocalyptic Human-Covenant War concluded, members of both sides are faced with an uncertain future in a politically complex environment of numerous different factions and affiliations, while ancient Forerunner entities and technologies continue to involve themselves with the galaxy’s affairs.”</p>

<h2 id="playing-halo-breakpoint">Playing Halo Breakpoint</h2>

<p>Halo: Breakpoint is best played on a battlefield around 3ft by 4ft and is designed for 28mm scale, individually based miniatures. Most games will feature several squads of models and larger games may include vehicles.</p>

<p>A game of Halo: Breakpoint lasts for 6 rounds.</p>

<h3 id="vehicles">Vehicles</h3>

<p>Models with the “Vehicle” special rule have the following changes to their rules: Vehicles may make a free attack action against any unit it comes into base contact with using the Vehicle Ram weapon.</p>

<h3 id="special-rules">Special Rules</h3>

<p>The following special rules are used in Halo Firefight games:</p>

      <td style="text-align: left">Attacks against this model have -1 to their Attack Roll and an additional -1 for every full 12 inches of distance between the attacker and target. If this model is hit by any attacks, takes an attack action, or spends more than 3 Command Points during an activation it loses the Active Camo rule for the remainder of the round.</td>

      <td style="text-align: left">Officer</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">Units that contain an Officer model do not have to roll when activating with a single command point, they automatically pass the test.

<h2 id="building-an-army">Building an Army</h2>

<p>When building an army for Halo: Breakpoint you choose units from the provided army lists, adding up the points for the models, their weapons, and equipment.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Small games are played with armies up to 200 points.</li>
  <li>Standard games are played with armies up to 300 points.</li>
  <li>Larger games can be played at 400 and 500 points but these typically require a much larger battlefield.</li>
</ul>

<p>For more sustained battles players can choose to add 100 points of reinforcements, additional units of any kind which become available from the start of round 3 to be deployed from reserve.</p>

<p>There are 3 types of unit available to add to your army: Standard, Specialist and Vehicles. Your army must contain at least 50% Standard units by points, and no more than 50% Specialist units. Vehicles count as Specialist units and are only used in games of 400 or more points (unless players agree to use them).</p>
