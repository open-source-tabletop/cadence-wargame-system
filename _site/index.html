                <section>
                    <p>Cadence is a modern tabletop wargame ruleset designed from the ground up to be lightweight, miniatures agnostic, free and open source, and flexible enough to be used in a wide variety of games. You will find both the <a href="/core-rules/">Core Rules</a> to the game here as well as a number of <a href="https://cadence.games/modules/">games that you can try</a> across a variety of settings. Beyond that you can create your own games and contribute to the development of the system and its games.</p>

  <h3>Cadence will feel familiar to players because...</h3>
  <p>The fundamental system of cadence is built around models, organised into units, alternately taking turns to perform actions like moving and shooting. Players use plain six sided dice to determine the outcome of most actions. These fundamentals are time tested and work great so they underpin the entire system.</p>
  <h3>Cadence will feel fresh to players because...</h3>
  <p>The Command Point system allows the action of the game to stay focused where its happening, allowing events to progress cinematically. It's a little less linear than most other games and gives the game a unique rhythm, or <strong>'Cadence'</strong>. There are more unique rules and streamlined systems to discover as you learn the rules.</p>
<div class="box alt">
<h2>Why play Cadence</h2>
    <h3>It's small, and fast!</h3>
    <p>The rules are streamlined, focusing the gameplay on the miniatures on the table, removing bloated maintenance steps or memorising lots of rules. The simple 'Entry Point' mechanic also maximises the use of space on your battlefield to allow bigger games in smaller areas.</p>
    <h3>Variety built in</h3>
    <p>The rules are a framework for games rather than a game themselves, meaning that each game can utilise them in the ways that work best. Does that mean all the games are the same? While they have the same core, unique game rules and army lists keep everything fresh.</p>
    <h3>Make it your own</h3>
    <p>The core rules provide a foundation so making your own game to play with any miniature you like is quick and easy. Expand on them with your own interesting mechanics and even publish your game since Cadence uses the Creative Commons by Attribution 4.0 License.</p>
