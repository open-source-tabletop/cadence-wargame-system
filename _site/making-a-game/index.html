                    <p>One of the best parts of Cadence is using the core rules to make your own game with the system, whether you have a small idea you want to have fun with or a big project you plan to release commercially - cadence makes for a solid foundation. This article will cover some simple steps you can follow to get started making a game in Cadence, though this article doesn’t get into concepts about planning and designing larger projects.</p>

<h3 id="the-big-idea">The Big Idea</h3>

<p>A good first step is usually to pull together all the ideas you have for your game and make some notes. Maybe you already have a setting in mind or just some general ideas, consider what miniatures you want to use, what scale they are in, and any themes or concepts that come to mind when you think of your game. A page or 2 of notes that cover this is a handy reference throughout this process.</p>

<h3 id="basic-rules-and-factions">Basic Rules and Factions</h3>

<p>At this stage it’s time to start planning out your module. A great way to do this is to create an outline document consisting of a heirarchy of headings. You might include some major sections for backgroud, custom rules, factions or army lists, missions, or campaigns. If you are planning to have multiple different factions or complex missions or campaigns you could consider having these as separate documents.</p>

<p>Once you have your major headings, add some sub-headings to guide your writing. For your rules, for example, perhaps you are considering some unique rules for movement, for magic, unique resources or terrain. By starting with the headings you get a better feel for your game. Don’t feel you need to write a long set of rules and lore, a game module with a few unit rules and a basic mission is as complete as a multi page document.</p>

<h3 id="custom-game-rules">Custom Game Rules</h3>

<p>It can be appealing to create custom mechanics to give your game a unique feel, and this is key to what makes Cadence so much fun. However there is always a balance to be found. Too many custom rules or modifications to existing rules can make your game feel very intensive to play. This is not to say that there is no place for complex mechanics but simply to be aware that a custom rule in isolation can seem simple and straightforward, but then feel slow and confusing on the table.</p>

<p>Always consider if a rule can be simplified, if an existing rule can be adapted to serve the same purpose, or if the rule should be cut. Also consider that, as you develop your factions, your rules may grow and that play testing as early and as often as possible will help you best decide on what to include.</p>

<h3 id="factions-and-army-lists">Factions and Army Lists</h3>

<p>The rules that represent your chosen miniatures on the tabletop are probably the most important, and can be the most time consuming to create. Let’s start by looking at what a unit really is:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>1 or multiple models per unit</strong>: while the size of your units is probably something you have in mind from the start, consider how this affects gameplay. Smaller units have less immediate impact with play passing more quickly between players, however it can lead to a large number of units which slows play down. Large units can feel more powerful but lack flexibility in smaller games.</li>
  <li><strong>Command Points</strong>: each unit can have between 1 and 6 command points dictating how much they do overall during a round. 1 is barely functional for a unit while 2 or 3 will normally mean a single activation in a round. Keeping this level across a whole game would create a very traditional game flow. Higher numbers of Command Points will mean that action tends to stay where it’s happening as players return to action before moving on, or introduces interesting tactical choices. Having different values for different units is a great way to differentiate units without just increasing damage or durability.</li>
  <li><strong>Speed and Range</strong>: while we could look at each attribute individually, one of the key things to focus on is how fast a unit is and from how far it can deal damage. Getting these right will be critical to how your game feels. If your units are fast and deadly up close players will be aiming to position themselves for impactful strikes, if your units can destroy each other from across the board then the game will stall into a dice rolling competition.</li>
</ul>

<p>With these aspects in mind you can begin to build your army lists. You may need to consider at this point how many factions and unit types you need. The more you decide to make, the longer this step becomes, and the harder it is to balance competitively. If possible, use a single set of units that can be customised, or keep the unit count as low as possible in each faction.</p>

<h3 id="points-and-balance">Points and Balance</h3>

<p>One of the hardest things to do is to balance your game for competitive play. This typically involves some kind of points system for units that equates to their effectiveness on the battlefield, but also includes rules for how players build their army, and restrictions on certain units or weapons. This process is important but also imperfect - you will likely never perfectly balance your game (and that’s probably ok).</p>

<p>A good place to start is with your most basic unit. Pick a number that feels right and begin costing everything else comparatively from there. Comparison between units is a great tool here but it doesn’t work for everything. There is no equation for adding up a units attributes and equipment to get to a perfect number. Use your best judgement. Compile armies using your points and compare those. Do lots of maths. Really, you are just trying at this stage to approximate a balanced points system.</p>

<p>The real test of balance comes on the tabletop. If you want to get a feel for balance you will need to play games. Ideally you want to play against different opponents, play different scenarios, different combinations of units, but testing against yourself is still valid feedback.</p>

<h3 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it all Together</h3>

<p>Now that you have written your module rules, army lists, background information, and included any extra components like missions or campaign rules, you need to package it for people to play. You are free to publish your game, alongside the core rules if you wish, in any way you want. You could put it together as a downloadable PDF, publish on your own site or on github. However you release it remember to include attribution to the original project by including a link to the Github Repo. Create an issue or post in discussions on the Github Repo if you would like your game published on Cadence.Games.</p>
