						<h2>Devils' Bluff</h2>
						
						<p>A Wild West Skirmish game in the lawless town of Devil's Bluff</p>
						
					</div>
				</header>
				
				<p>Welcome to the town of Devil’s Bluff: a lawless place where anything goes and danger walks hand-in-hand with opportunity. In this fast-paced skirmish game, you’ll put together a gang of gunslingers, battle for dominance, wealth, and power, as you build your Wild West legend.</p>

<h2 id="module-rules">Module Rules</h2>

<h3 id="playing-devils-bluff">Playing Devil’s Bluff</h3>

<p>Devil’s Bluff requires a battlefield around 2ft by 3ft, or something with a similar area. Each game of Devil’s Bluff lasts for 4 rounds.</p>

<p>Each gang will normally consist of between 6 and 10 models. You will need a selection of 28mm scale miniatures suitable for a Wild West theme and may include models that have a mounted version.</p>

<h3 id="action-call-horse">Action: Call Horse</h3>

<p>Models that purchased a horse as part of their equipment may call it during their activation. The player rolls a d6 and on a roll of a 2 or more the model gains the <strong>Mounted</strong> special rule. A model with the <strong>Mounted</strong> special rule may choose to dismount, removing the special rule, at the start of any subsequent activation.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The model must be at Height Level 0 to perform this action.</li>
  <li>The model may not have any enemy models within 3 inches to perform this action.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>During play it is best to have both a mounted and on foot version of your miniature, however a token can be used in it’s place. The horse is not represented separately from the rider in this game, it is assumed that it moves away from the battle when not being ridden and (usually) responds when called.</em></p>
