<h3 id="a-bad-hand">A Bad Hand</h3>

<p>In the heart of the rugged Arizona landscape, where the sun beats down on the scorched earth and the winds carry tales of despair and hope, there lies the town of Barton’s Bluff. Tucked away from the prying eyes of the law and the watchful gaze of the righteous, this once-promising settlement has become a haven for darkness and deceit.</p>

<p>Barton’s Bluff, named after the towering bluff that looms over its outskirts, was once full of promise. With large tracts of fertile farmland and rich veins of coal hidden deep within the surrounding hills, the prospect of wealth and prosperity seemed within reach. However, the pursuit of profit and power comes with a heavy cost.</p>

<p>Unscrupulous landowners, wealthy mine operators, and ruthless businessmen set their sights on Barton’s Bluff, their greed casting a long shadow over the town. Over time the people, now weary and downtrodden, began to refer to their home as Devil’s Bluff—a testament to the evil that had taken root.</p>

<p>Recognizing the darkness that had befallen their town, the local priest orchestrated a gathering within the sacred walls of the church. Seeing an opportunity to solidify their hold on the town, the heads of each group came, along with their trusted lieutenants, assembled in this unlikely sanctuary, each seeking to set themselves above the others.</p>

<p>But fate had other plans.</p>

<p>As the discussions heated to a frenzied clamour, the very foundations of the town shuddered beneath the weight of their sins. The earth itself rebelled as the town was hit by an earthquake. Chaos erupted as part the bluff crumbled, covering the town in a haze of dust. As the shaking subsided and people began to gather their wits they saw that their town had been spared any significant damage, all except from the church which had been crushed completely, along with its ill-fated.</p>

<h3 id="playing-the-cards-youre-dealt">Playing the cards you’re dealt</h3>

<p>As a new day dawned, a new chapter started in Barton’s Bluff—one of opportunity and treacherous ambition. The high and mighty had fallen, silenced by the cruel hand of fate. A power vacuum emerged, leaving the workers, the small-time gangs, the hired thugs, and the few righteous souls to vie for control over the remnants of the fractured town.</p>

<p>Each faction harbored its own desires—for power, for wealth, for the restoration of law and order, and everyone must choose a side. . Put together your posse, embrace your cause, and set your sights on the destiny of Devil’s Bluff.</p>
