Scraplands Showdown is a vehicular racing and combat game.

## Module Rules

Scraplands Showdown is best played on a 3ft x 3ft or similar sized area.

The models in Scraplands represent ramshackle vehicles with makeshift weapons and armour. These models should be around the 1:64 scale similar to die cast model cars. These models are referred to throughout this module as cars.

## Car Arcs

Instead of just a front and rear arc a car also has a left and right side arc. These are defined by the 4 corners of the car: The front arc extends out from the front 2 corners with the sides of this arc extending out at 45 degrees to the forward direction. The rear arc is the same from tbe back cornerstone of the vehicle extending out to the backwards direction. The left and right side arcs are the spaces between the front and back on either side of the car.

## Car Movement

When moving one of your cars they must always move directly forward up to their allowed movement distance. Vehicles may not pivot freely during their movement, instead they may make pivot up to 45 degrees at the cost of 2 inches of their remaining movement.

instead of moving normally you may spend a single Command Point on a move action to move directly backwards up to 3 inches.

## Passing and Blocking 

Cars are permitted to move over the base of any friendly or enemy model so long as they have sufficient movement to do so.

If moving over an enemy vehicle that player may attempt to block the car from passing. Both players roll-off, if the player trying to move over the enemy model wins they finish moving their model as normal. If the player being passed wins the moving model stops it's movement before moving over the enemy car and it's activation ends. In the event of a tie the passing vehicle wins.

## Terrain

### Impassable

If a car would move into impassable terrain it stops moving immediately and it's activation ends. If the player spent 2 Command Points then the player rolls 3d6, for each roll of a 6 they take 4 damage and must make Defence Rolls as normal.

### Wreckage

Wreckage is smaller terrain that cars may move through at an additional cost of 1 inch of their movement. They must also roll 3d6, for each roll of a 6 they take 3 damage and must make Defencce Rolls as normal.

## Ramming

All vehicles count as having the following weapons:

| Weapon    | Rng | Att | Dmg | Prc | Special Rules        |
