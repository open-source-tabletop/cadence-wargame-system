## Module Rules

### Playing Scraplands Showdown

Scraplands Showdown is best played on a 3ft x 3ft or similar sized area.

The models in Scraplands represent ramshackle vehicles with makeshift weapons and armour. These models should be around the 1:64 scale similar to die cast model cars. These models are referred to throughout this module as cars.
