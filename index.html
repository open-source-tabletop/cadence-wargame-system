<h3>Lightweight Wargaming Rules for any Setting</h3>
<p>Cadence is a tabletop miniature Wargaming System with a flexible ruleset that allows games to be played in a huge variety of styles and settings. Cadence is a simple system, easy to learn, but with enough depth to keep games interesting. The Core Rules provide a foundation that game modules expand upon to add their own elements, creating unqiue games that are quick to pick up and play.</p>
