<h3>Lightweight Wargaming Rules for any Setting</h3>

<p>Cadence is a tabletop miniature Wargaming System with a flexible ruleset that allows games to be played in a huge variety of styles and settings. Cadence is a simple system, easy to learn, but with enough depth to keep games interesting. The Core Rules provide a foundation that game modules expand upon to add their own elements, creating unqiue games that are quick to pick up and play.</p>

<h3>Use any miniatures in your games</h3>

<p>Cadence is a ruleset designed to be miniature agnostic: meaning there's no set rules about which miniatures you use. Modules and army lists are designed to be somewhat generic allowing you as much freedom as you want in your collection.</p>
